## [4.0.2] — 2026-05-05

**Patch release.** Closes the `audit-2026-05-04` cycle's MEDIUM-band
findings + all 3 NEEDS-CONTEXT findings. v4.0.1 closed CRITICAL+HIGH;
v4.0.2 closes the entire MEDIUM band, completing audit cycle 2. Genesis
105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved end-to-end (verified via
deterministic-record SHA compare on every commit cluster):

  - `bitstring_vectors`   `bd4d14ca1ba070b7…`  MATCH
  - `seed_words_vectors`  `6c9a2577c23caa64…`  MATCH
  - `bitmap_vectors`      `cd530b3b125a4546…`  MATCH
  - `historical/leto`     `daad91d2427ddb2b…`  MATCH
  - `historical/artemis`  `abd32a4660819d63…`  MATCH
  - `historical/apollo`   `7bc541f94fa3cd4a…`  MATCH

Final extended-elided SHA-256 (unchanged since v3.0.0):
  - `v1_genesis.json`     `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae`
  - `v1_historical.json`  `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b`

**Audit cycle 2 status, post-v4.0.2:** 21/21 MEDIUM findings + 3/3
NEEDS-CONTEXT findings dispositioned. The cycle's MEDIUM band is closed.
See [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) "Audit Cycle 2 Close-Out" section for the
per-finding disposition matrix.

### Why a patch release?

Same rationale as v4.0.1: every fix here is either a Go-side library
hardening (no TS public-surface change), a TS-side additive change
(new typed exception classes — pure addition, no removal), a perf
micro-optimization (byte-identical output), a doc-only update, or a
test-only addition. The published `@stoachain/dalos-crypto` npm
package's wire format, behaviour, and exports are byte-identical to
v4.0.1 at the **happy-path** surface — only error-class type info
on the gen1 surface gains new branches (additive, not breaking).

### Schnorr cofactor dispatch generalisation (commit `cf5b2fe`)

#### F-MED-017 — Cofactor scalar Go vs TS divergence

`Elliptic/Schnorr.go` previously used a package-level `cofactor4 =
big.NewInt(4)` constant for the small-subgroup attack rejection check.
The TS port (`ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`) used `e.r` from the curve struct.
All currently-defined curves have cofactor 4, so the divergence was
benign today — but adding a future cofactor-8 curve to either side would
silently downgrade Go's check to the wrong scalar.

**Fix:** hybrid dispatch helper `cofactorCheckRejects(P CoordExtended)`:

  - **h=4 fast path** (DALOS Genesis + all currently-defined curves):
    two chained doublings, `IsInfinityPoint` check. Byte-identical to
    v4.0.1 behaviour; no perf regression.
  - **h ∈ {1, 2, 8, …}** (any other power of 2): `k` chained doublings.
  - **h non-power-of-2** (e.g. Curve448 with h=4 but generalised): falls
    back to `e.ScalarMultiplier(big.NewInt(int64(h)), P)`.

Mirror dispatch shipped on the TS side at `ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`.
Cross-language parity restored.

**New documentation:** [`docs/COFACTOR_GENERALIZATION.md`](docs/COFACTOR_GENERALIZATION.md)
(~430 lines) covers the math, the small-subgroup attack threat model,
the per-cofactor implementation strategy table, hand-construction of
h-torsion adversarial test vectors, and a worked Ed25519 (h=8) example.
"For AI agents" section explains how to safely extend the codebase to
new cofactors without tripping the Genesis byte-identity gate.

### Documentation hardening — `from*` entry-point scope

#### F-MED-018 — `fullKeyFromBitString` always uses DALOS prefixes

Audit flagged that calling `fromBitString(bits, LETO)` on the TS gen1
surface returns a `DalosFullKey` whose `keyPair.publ` is a valid LETO
public key but whose `standardAddress` and `smartAddress` use Ouronet
Genesis prefixes. The registry-mediated path (`gen1-factory.ts`) re-stamps
prefixes correctly; direct `from*` callers do not.

**Resolution: DOCUMENTED-NOT-FIXED.** The gen1 surface is intentionally
DALOS-default — it ships the Genesis primitive and not the full multi-
curve registry. Multi-curve consumers route via the `/registry` subpath
which does the per-curve prefix stamping (see OuronetUI's
`src/lib/dalos/key-gen.ts` for the canonical pattern). Mirrors the
F-API-006 / F-TEST-002 architectural-boundary precedent: document the
intentional asymmetry rather than dissolve it. Diagnostic test script
(`ts/check_med018.mjs`) preserved in the working tree for empirical
verification of the documented scope.

### Cluster A — CLI hardening + Elliptic purity (commit `30cd056`)

5 MEDIUM findings closed; Genesis byte-identity preserved.

#### F-MED-001 — `-g` input-method branches not mutually exclusive

Pre-fix: five sibling `if` blocks (no `else if`) for `-raw / -bits /
-seed / -i10 / -i49` dispatch. Multi-flag invocations (`dalos -g -raw
-bits 0101…`) generated, printed, and attempted to save TWO unrelated
wallets in one run. Confirmed by audit-bug-detector (F-BUG-002).

**Fix:** two layers of defense at `Dalos.go`:
  - Explicit multi-flag rejection BEFORE dispatch (counts how many input
    flags are set; rejects if > 1 with a clear message).
  - Converted dispatch to `else if` chain so a future contributor adding
    a 6th input method without updating the count check sees only ONE
    branch fire.

#### F-MED-002 — `-p PASSWORD` shell-history leak

`-p PASSWORD` leaks via shell history, `/proc/PID/cmdline`, `ps -ef`,
auditd, container logs. **Resolution: DOCUMENTED-NOT-FIXED.** The
proper fix (interactive `term.ReadPassword` fallback) requires
`golang.org/x/term`, which would break this package's "no external
deps" invariant (see `go.mod` F-MED-003 docstring). The CLI is
documented as a developer convenience, NOT for production wallet
management. Limitation documented inline at `Dalos.go`'s `-p` flag
declaration.

#### F-MED-004 — Wallet password no minimum-strength validation

Pre-fix: only empty-string check at `-p`. Combined with the documented
AES-2 single-pass-Blake3 KDF (no salt), passwords < ~12 chars are
GPU-brute-forceable in days.

**Fix:** added 16-character minimum length validation at the `-p` flag
boundary. 16 chars at ~70-char alphabet gives ~3.3e29 combinations —
safe against any realistic attacker even without KDF strengthening.
Note: this validates the password the user supplied; KDF half remains
policy-locked (Genesis frozen).

#### F-MED-006 — `confirmSeedWords` calls `os.Exit(1)` from helper

Phase 10 / REQ-31 / v4.0.0 introduced sentinel-return convention.
`confirmSeedWords` predated it, called `os.Exit(1)` from 3 sites.
Inconsistent + harder to test (cannot exercise without spawning
subprocess).

**Fix:** refactored to `confirmSeedWords(...) error`; `main()` exits.

#### F-MED-016 — `ValidatePrivateKey` retains `fmt.Println`

Phase 10 / REQ-31 explicitly stated "`Elliptic/` retains pure-crypto
only". Three `fmt.Println` sites inside `ValidatePrivateKey` violated
this — library consumer cannot suppress them; goes to stdout
unconditionally.

**Fix:** `(bool, string)` return widened to `(valid bool, bitString
string, reason string)`. Failure reason returned to caller; CLI
driver renders the reason itself. Mirrors the TS port's
`validateBitmap`'s `{ valid, reason? }` shape. Per-call sites in
`Dalos.go` updated to print the new reason field.

### Cluster B — Library API hygiene (commit `05eb8dd`)

3 MEDIUM findings closed; Genesis byte-identity preserved.

#### F-MED-008 — TS `from*` API entry points threw bare `Error`

Pre-fix: 5 throw sites in `ts/src/gen1/key-gen.ts` threw
`new Error(...)` with diagnostic strings. Consumers wanting to
differentiate "bad bitstring" from "bad scalar" from "bad bitmap" had
to do `String(err.message).includes('bitstring')` — brittle to wording
changes. The Schnorr surface gained `SchnorrSignError` in v3.0.3 but
the key-gen surface lagged.

**Fix:** 3 new typed error classes in `ts/src/gen1/errors.ts`:
  - `InvalidBitStringError` — thrown by `generateScalarFromBitString`
    (and any `from*` path that funnels through it).
  - `InvalidPrivateKeyError` — thrown by `scalarToPrivateKey`,
    `fromIntegerBase10`, `fromIntegerBase49`.
  - `InvalidBitmapError` — thrown by `fromBitmap`.

5 throw sites in `key-gen.ts` swapped from bare `Error` to the typed
classes. `error.message` text unchanged (additive change, no break).
Re-exported from `ts/src/gen1/index.ts`. Consumer pattern documented
in `errors.ts` module docstring with a worked catch-by-class example.

#### F-MED-009 — `keystore.ImportPrivateKey` writes to stdout

v4.0.0 carve-out made `keystore` standalone consumable; library
function still emitted `"DALOS Keys are being opened!"` and `"Public
Key verification successful!"` to stdout. Server / GUI / JSON-pipe
consumers couldn't suppress them.

**Fix:** removed both `fmt.Println` calls from `keystore/import.go`
(library purity restored). Breadcrumb prints relocated to both
`keystore.ImportPrivateKey` call sites in `Dalos.go` (`-open` and
`-sign` branches), preserving CLI behaviour byte-for-byte. HARDENING
docstring on `keystore/import.go` explains the carve-out rationale
and the relocation pattern.

#### F-MED-020 — `EllipseMethods` interface missing `GenerateFromBitmap`

`(*Ellipse).GenerateFromBitmap` (added v1.2.0) is a public method but
was missing from `EllipseMethods`. Phase 11 conformance assertion only
enforced `*Ellipse ⊇ EllipseMethods`, not the inverse — consumers
dispatching through the interface type couldn't call
`GenerateFromBitmap`.

**Fix:** added the missing declaration to `EllipseMethods` in
`Elliptic/PointOperations.go`. The `Bitmap` import is the first
dependency this package takes on `Bitmap`; previously only the
`*Ellipse` method body referenced it.

### Cluster C — Test coverage gaps (commit `510913b`)

3 MEDIUM findings closed via 1,144 lines of new test coverage. Pure
additions; no production code changed except a 2-line latent-bug fix
in `E521Ellipse()` surfaced by the cross-curve sweep. Genesis
byte-identity preserved.

#### F-MED-012 — Blake3 had zero direct tests

Pre-fix: `Blake3/{Blake3,Compress,CompressGeneric}.go` had no tests.
Indirect coverage came only from the Genesis corpus.

**Fix:** new `Blake3/Blake3_test.go` (336 lines) with two complementary
strategies:

  1. **KAT lock for empty input.** Hardcoded `af1349b9…f3262` from
     BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3 `test_vectors.json`. Catches the broadest class
     of round-function / IV / flag-handling regressions.
  2. **Internal cross-path consistency tests.** All 3 fast paths inside
     `Sum512` (single-block, single-chunk, multi-chunk) and all output
     paths (`Sum256`, `Sum512`, `Sum1024`, `SumCustom`, `XOF`,
     `Hasher.Write+Sum`) MUST agree on overlapping inputs. 7 cross-path
     tests cover this.

#### F-MED-013 — AES core had no direct tests

Pre-fix: only `BitStringToHex_doc_test.go` existed; the core
`EncryptBitString` / `DecryptBitString` / `MakeKeyFromPassword` /
`ZeroBytes` surface had no direct tests. Correctness was indirect
through `keystore_test.go`'s Export → Import round-trip.

**Fix:** new `AES/AES_test.go` (337 lines) with seven test families:
round-trip integrity (with the AES-1/2 retry helper), wrong-password
rejection, tampered-ciphertext rejection (locks GCM authentication),
KDF determinism + non-degeneracy, nonce randomness (catches GCM nonce
reuse), `ZeroBytes` scrub (KG-3 v2.1.0 memory hygiene primitive).

#### F-MED-014 — HWCD point ops had no direct tests

Pre-fix: `PointOperations.go`'s core arithmetic (`Addition` + V1/V2/V3,
`Doubling` + V1/V2, `Tripling`, `FortyNiner`, `ScalarMultiplier`)
had no isolated tests. A bug in the Tripling formula that happens to
preserve corpus inputs would slip through.

**Fix:** new `Elliptic/PointOperations_test.go` (460 lines) with 11
tests, each running across all 5 curves (DALOS, E521, LETO, ARTEMIS,
APOLLO) for 44 cross-curve subtest cases:

  - **Identity element:** `IsInfinityPoint`, `IsOnCurve` on O and G,
    `Addition(G, O) = G`.
  - **Group order (most important crypto invariant):**
    `[Q]·G = O` on EVERY curve. `[1]·G = G`. `[2]·G = Doubling(G)`.
  - **Group axiom consistency:** `Addition(P, P) = Doubling(P)`,
    `Tripling(P) = Addition(2P, P)`, commutativity, associativity.
  - **Dispatch + helper consistency:** `Addition`'s V1/V2 dispatch
    matches direct `AdditionV1/V2` calls. `Doubling` V1/V2 same.
    `FortyNiner(P) = [49]·P` (locks the scalar-mult base-49
    digit decomposition).

**Latent-bug fix bundled:** `E521Ellipse()` (`Elliptic/Parameters.go`)
was missing `e.G.AX = new(big.Int)` and `e.G.AY = new(big.Int)`
allocations since v1.0.0 — the function panicked on call. No
production or test callers existed (verified via grep), so the bug
went undetected for the entire codebase lifetime. Surfaced by the
cross-curve test sweep adding the first real caller; fixed inline
with explanatory comment.

### Cluster D — Hot-path optimizations (commit `9a28e4c`)

2 MEDIUM perf findings closed across Go and TS with full cross-language
parity. Genesis byte-identity preserved.

#### F-MED-010 — `ConvertHashToBitString` O(n²) string concatenation

Pre-fix Go: `var full string; for _, b := range Hash { full +=
fmt.Sprintf("%08b", b) }`. Go strings are immutable; `+=` in a loop
allocates a new backing array on every iteration. For DALOS (200-byte
hash → 1600-char bitstring) that's 200 allocs of 8/16/24/…/1600 bytes
≈ 160 KB of intermediate garbage per call.

**Fix Go (`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go`):** `strings.Builder.Grow +
WriteByte` with an inlined 8-bit big-endian render (skips the
`fmt.Sprintf` temporary allocation per call). Mirrors the existing
`GenerateRandomBitsOnCurve` pattern in the same file.

**Fix TS (`ts/src/gen1/hashing.ts`):** swapped `let full = ''; for
(...) full += ...` to `parts: string[]` + `parts.join('')`. Mirrors
the existing REQ-29 `bigIntToBase49` pattern.

#### F-MED-011 — SchnorrVerify re-parses the public key string

Pre-fix: `SchnorrVerify` already parsed the public key into `PAffine`
(line 556), then called `e.SchnorrHash(r, PublicKey, Message)` (line
584), which re-ran `ConvertPublicKeyToAffineCoords(PublicKey)` — a
~700-char base-49 → big.Int parse, O(n²) inside `math/big`. Wasted
work on every verify.

**Fix:** extracted `(*Ellipse).schnorrHashFromAffine(R, PAffine,
Message)` private helper. `SchnorrHash` itself parses and delegates;
`SchnorrVerify` skips the parse and calls `schnorrHashFromAffine`
directly. Public API unchanged.

**TS mirror (`ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`):** added exported
`schnorrHashFromAffine(R, pkAffine, message, e)`; routed both
`schnorrVerify` (sync) and `schnorrVerifyAsync` through it. Sign
path's `self.schnorrHash` indirection preserved (existing test spies
in `ts/tests/gen1/schnorr.test.ts` continue to work).

### Cluster E — Audit-cycle close-out (commit `a984ec2`)

Documentation-only commit dispositioning two MEDIUM findings without
code changes:

  - **F-MED-019** ❎ NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN — `dist/gen1/` lacks 4 v3.0.3+
    exports. Verified `git ls-files ts/dist/` returns 0 entries; `dist/`
    is in `ts/.gitignore`. The local `dist/` is a developer-side build
    artifact only; CI rebuilds from `src/` on every release. Local
    `npm link` consumers should run `npm run build` themselves.
    Promoting to a tracked-`dist/` model would defeat the CI rebuild
    guarantee.
  - **F-MED-021** ✅ STALE — already fixed in v4.0.1 (commit `a191bfa`)
    under tracking ID **F-INT-002**. The auditor's snapshot pre-dated
    the fix; report wasn't refreshed against post-fix state.

### Group 1 — Selective error-wrap policy (commit `b83646b`)

Two coordinated findings closed via OWASP-aligned selective `%w`-wrap
at the wallet-decrypt boundary. Genesis byte-identity preserved.

#### F-NEEDS-001 — Wrong-password / corrupt-ciphertext oracle

Pre-fix `AesGcm.Open` failure path:
```go
return "", fmt.Errorf("AES DecryptBitString Open (likely wrong
                      password or corrupt ciphertext): %w", err)
```
Two leak vectors: (a) parenthetical names the failure CLASS, (b) `%w`
wrap exposes inner GCM error string (`"cipher: message authentication
failed"`) to any consumer that calls `errors.Unwrap` or
`fmt.Errorf("%v", inner)`.

**Fix (`AES/AES.go`):** flat `errors.New("AES DecryptBitString:
authentication failed")`. NO unwrap chain, NO inner-string exposure,
NO failure-class hint. Wrong-password and tampered-ciphertext are now
indistinguishable through every layer above this primitive.

**Test contract added (`AES/AES_test.go`):** `TestDecrypt_WrongPassword`
strengthened to lock the F-NEEDS-001 contract programmatically with
3 assertions: (1) function-prefix preserved (log identifiability),
(2) `errors.Unwrap(err)` returns nil (catches `%w` regression),
(3) GCM-internal tokens forbidden (catches `%v` regression — leaks
the inner string without an unwrap chain).

#### F-MED-005 — `keystore.ImportPrivateKey` selective `%w`-wrap

Pre-fix: every error site in `keystore/import.go` used `errors.New`,
flattening even the structural errors that don't leak oracle bits.

**Fix (`keystore/import.go`):** selective wrap by error category:
  - `os.ReadFile` failure: wraps with `%w` + path context.
  - AESDecrypt failure (auth-tag boundary): KEEPS the flat generic
    error per F-NEEDS-001. Inner err deliberately discarded with
    explicit `_ = err2` + inline policy comment.
  - `GenerateScalarFromBitString` failure (post-decrypt — pwd was
    correct): wraps with `%w` + corruption context.
  - `ScalarToKeys` failure (post-decrypt): wraps with `%w` + version-
    skew context.
  - PUBL-mismatch: improved message naming both common causes (file
    tampering or cross-curve mismatch).

### Group 2 — Fail-fast on contractually-nil errors + explicit infinity binding (commit `f40e636`)

Two NEEDS-CONTEXT findings closed via the v2.1.0 PO-3 fail-fast
convention. Genesis byte-identity preserved.

#### F-NEEDS-002 — Blake3 contractually-nil errors silently swallowed

Pre-fix `Blake3/Blake3.go` had 4 sites that discarded errors via bare
`_, _ =`:
  - `Hasher.Sum`'s XOF-read path (line 138)
  - `Sum512`'s multi-chunk path (line 216)
  - `Sum1024` (line 225)
  - `SumCustom` (line 234)

Per `io.Writer` contract, `hash.Hash.Write` returns nil unconditionally;
`OutputReader.Read` returns `io.EOF` only after MaxUint64 bytes —
unreachable in practice. Today no-op suppressions of contractually-nil
errors. But the bare `_, _ =` is fragile: if a future upstream-library
change introduces a non-nil error, the existing code would silently
corrupt the digest output (worst possible failure mode for a hash).

**Fix:** explicit panic-on-non-nil pattern matching the v2.1.0 PO-3
convention (`Elliptic/PointOperations.go`'s `noErrAddition` /
`noErrDoubling`):
```go
if _, err := h.Write(b); err != nil {
    panic(fmt.Sprintf("Blake3.<Caller>: Hasher.Write returned
                      unexpected err: %v", err))
}
```
Caller named in the panic message for debug-path obviousness. Zero
runtime overhead in the common case.

#### F-NEEDS-003 — `IsOnCurve` infinity flag silently dropped

Pre-fix `SchnorrVerify` (Go) and `schnorrVerify` / `schnorrVerifyAsync`
(TS) discarded the second return value of `IsOnCurve` (the Infinity
flag). The cofactorCheckRejects call at the next layer (F-SEC-001 /
F-MED-017) DID reject infinity, so the practical attack surface was
unchanged today — but the implicit reliance was fragile.

**Fix Go (`Elliptic/Schnorr.go`):** explicit `Infinity`-flag binding
at both R-side and P-side `IsOnCurve` calls inside `SchnorrVerify`.

**Fix TS (cross-language parity bonus, `ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`):**
same pattern applied at 4 sites across `schnorrVerify` (sync) and
`schnorrVerifyAsync`. The audit only filed F-NEEDS-003 against the
Go side; the TS counterparts had identical drops and got the same fix.

### Group 3 — Toolchain hygiene + ValidateBitmap close-out (commit `c2eda8f`)

Final two MEDIUMs closed; audit cycle 2 MEDIUM band complete.

#### F-MED-003 — Go toolchain pin bumped 1.19 → 1.22

`go.mod`'s `go` directive was pinned to 1.19, which fell EOL in August
2023. Multiple Go stdlib CVEs landed since: CVE-2023-29406, CVE-2023-
39325, CVE-2024-24783, CVE-2024-24784, CVE-2024-34156. None touch
the Genesis cryptographic primitives, but the toolchain itself stops
receiving security backports once it falls out of the supported
window.

**Fix:** `go.mod` directive bumped to `go 1.22` (currently supported,
matches CI's pre-existing pin in `.github/workflows/go-ci.yml`). No
external Go consumers verified on workspace `Z:\` (OuronetCore is
TypeScript). Comprehensive rationale docstring added to `go.mod`;
`CLAUDE.md`, `Dalos.go`'s F-MED-002 docstring, and the CI workflow
setup-Go comment all updated to reference the new minimum. Genesis
byte-identity preserved (math primitives produce bit-identical output
across Go 1.19 / 1.22 / 1.26).

#### F-MED-007 — `Bitmap.ValidateBitmap` close-out

`Bitmap.ValidateBitmap` is a no-op: returns nil unconditionally. The
function already carries a comprehensive HARDENING docstring (added in
F-API-006 v4.0.1) explaining why no real validation is performed.

**Resolution: NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN.** Three reasons documented in the
function docstring:
  1. The Go type system already enforces structural validity
     (`[40][40]bool` cannot hold non-bool values, cannot have wrong
     dimensions at the type level, cannot be a nil reference).
  2. A meaningful "is this a valid DALOS bitmap" check would have to
     be CURVE-SPECIFIC (DALOS uses 40×40=1600 bits, APOLLO uses 32×
     32=1024, LETO different again). Per-curve dimensioning belongs
     on the receiving Ellipse, not on the Bitmap helper.
  3. Entropy / "is this all zeros" checks are caught downstream by
     F-ERR-007's range check in `SchnorrSign`.

Cross-language asymmetry with TS's `validateBitmap` (which DOES check)
is INTENTIONAL — the TS port has to do dynamically what the Go type
system covers statically. Mirrors the F-API-006 / F-TEST-002 / F-MED-018
architectural-boundary precedent.

### Verification

For every fix in this release:
- `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` clean (local Go 1.26.2; CI Go 1.22).
- Full test suite passes (5 Go packages green, including new Blake3,
  AES, and PointOperations test files added in Cluster C).
- Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved at the deterministic-
  record-set level (6/6 hashes MATCH at every commit checkpoint — see
  table at top of this section).
- TS suite passes (typecheck + tests) — verified pre-shipping in CI's
  `gates` matrix (Node 20/22/24).

### Migration notes

**TypeScript port consumers:** the v4.0.2 npm package
(`@stoachain/dalos-crypto@4.0.2`) is wire-compatible with v4.0.1 at the
happy-path surface. New typed exception classes (F-MED-008) are
ADDITIVE — existing `catch (err) { String(err.message).includes(...) }`
patterns continue to work; new code can opt into class-based catch:

```typescript
import { fromBitString, InvalidBitStringError } from
  '@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1';

try {
  const key = fromBitString(userInput);
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof InvalidBitStringError) { /* handle */ }
  else throw e;
}
```

The new `schnorrHashFromAffine` export is additive — `schnorrHash`'s
public surface is unchanged.

**Go-reference consumers:** no library-signature changes in v4.0.2.
The minimum Go toolchain is now 1.22 (was 1.19 in v4.0.1).
`Elliptic.ValidatePrivateKey` gained a third return value (`reason
string`) — embedders need to update call sites, but the library has
no external Go consumers (verified during F-MED-003 triage).

The Schnorr cofactor-check helper (`cofactorCheckRejects`) is a new
private method — no public API impact.

## [4.0.1] — 2026-05-04

**Patch release.** Closes the `audit-2026-05-04` cycle's CRITICAL + HIGH
findings: hardening of error-handling, library-API contracts, and CLI
input validation. Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved at
extended-elided SHA-256 = `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae`
(unchanged since v3.0.0); historical SHA-256 = `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b`
(unchanged since v3.0.0).

**Audit context:** the pre-v4.0.1 audit cycle (after v4.0.0 shipped)
returned 60 substantive findings (2 CRITICAL, 16 HIGH, 23 MEDIUM, 20 LOW)
plus 3 NEEDS CONTEXT, with 0 false positives. v4.0.1 closes the CRITICAL
+ HIGH band; MEDIUM and LOW findings deferred to future cycles per the
"Critical + High mandatory, Medium triage, Low informational" policy
adopted during this triage session.

### Why a patch release?

Every fix here is either:
- A bug fix with no API surface change (Go-side panic-on-malformed-input
  for previously silent-corruption code paths — F-ERR-003), OR
- A **Go-side library signature widening** (function gains an `error`
  return). Pure additions — existing single-return-value callers fail
  to compile but the fix is mechanical and the only known consumer is
  this repo's own CLI + test suite. The published TypeScript port
  `@stoachain/dalos-crypto` is not affected by Go-side signatures.
- A CLI-only diagnostic improvement (F-CRIT-002, F-API-002, F-ERR-001).
- A TS-public-surface no-op (this release does not change any TS
  public exports; the npm package's wire format and behaviour are
  byte-identical to v4.0.0).

Per SemVer the Go signature changes would normally push to v5.0.0, but
this project's `lifecycle.tag_pattern` is `ts-v{version}` and the version
field in `ts/package.json` represents the **TypeScript package version**.
TS surface is unchanged → patch bump is correct for the tag-driven
release flow. The Go-side breaking changes are documented below for
anyone embedding the Go reference directly.

### Repository hygiene

#### F-CRIT-001 — Stray wallet artifact removed from repo root

Commit `844905a`. Real DALOS wallet file `9G.2idxjKM...fatDK0u.txt`
committed since the initial commit deleted from tracking. `.gitignore`
extended with `*...*.txt` glob (matches the
`{first7_pubkey}...{last7_pubkey}.txt` convention of
`keystore.GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey`) so future stray wallets in
the working directory don't get tracked.

Not a security compromise (the file holds an AES-256-GCM-encrypted
private key plus the public key + addresses, all of which are intended
to be public for the latter two and require password compromise for
the former), but cleaner not to ship a stray wallet bundle at repo
root.

### CLI fixes (`Dalos.go`)

#### F-CRIT-002 — `-g` validation guard inverted condition

Commit `b72e588`. The check at `Dalos.go:119` had inverted operators
on the last two operands: `*intaFlag != "" && *intbFlag != ""` should
have been `== "" && == ""`. The boolean expression could only be true
if BOTH `-i10` AND `-i49` were supplied, the opposite of what the
error message says. As a result `dalos -g -p mypassword` (omitting any
input flag) would silently exit 0 with no key generated and no error.

Fix: invert the two `!=` to `==`. Smoke test added at
`dalos_smoke_test.go::TestCLI_GenerateWithoutInputMethod_ExitsWithError`.
`AUDIT.md` CLI-1 row marked **FIXED**.

#### F-ERR-001 — `SaveBitString` infinite-loop hang on stdin EOF

Commit `3274d98`. Password-confirmation loop in `process.go:152-178`
discarded `fmt.Scanln`'s error. On closed stdin (CI, redirected
`</dev/null`, broken pipe, daemonised invocation), `Scanln` returned
`(0, io.EOF)` repeatedly; the empty `P2` never matched the password;
the `for {}` loop spun burning a CPU core indefinitely.
`dalos_smoke_test.go:27-31` already documented this hang, mitigated
only by a 30s context deadline in the test harness — production had
no guard.

Fix: check the `Scanln` error — `n == 0 && err != nil` triggers stderr
"stdin closed before password confirmation" + `os.Exit(1)`. Cap retries
at 3 to bound the human-typo case as well.

#### F-API-002 — Seed-word length error message wording

Commit `51aad47`. Validator at `Dalos.go:149-153` accepted words of
length 1-256 but the user-facing error message claimed "between 3 and
256" — the function lied about its own contract. Documented in
`AUDIT.md:247` (CLI-2). The actual contract (also in `README.md:71`)
is: 4-256 words, each 1-256 characters.

Fix: message corrected to "between 1 and 256". Smoke test added at
`dalos_smoke_test.go::TestCLI_SeedWord_TooLong_ExitsWithError` with
forbid-list assertion catching any future regression to the wrong
wording. `AUDIT.md` CLI-2 row marked **FIXED**.

### Filesystem / wallet hardening (`keystore/`)

#### F-SEC-002 — Wallet files now written `0600` instead of `0644`

Commit `2e27fca`. `os.Create` always uses mode 0644 (`rw-r--r--` on
POSIX), making exported wallet files world-readable on Linux/macOS.
The file contains the AES-256-GCM-encrypted private key plus the
matching public key — enough material for an offline brute-force
oracle if the password is weak.

Fix: `os.Create(FileName)` → `os.OpenFile(FileName, os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_TRUNC, 0o600)`.
Owner-only on POSIX. Windows ignores POSIX mode bits (NTFS uses ACLs)
so behaviour there is unchanged.

#### F-ERR-005 — `ExportPrivateKey` returns error, no silent wallet truncation

Commit `f9ef84b`. **Go-side breaking change** (function signature gains
an `error` return).

Pre-v4.0.1 the function discarded every error from the 11× `fmt.Fprintln`
+ 1× `fmt.Fprint` calls plus the deferred `OutputFile.Close`. If the
disk filled mid-write, the network FS disconnected, or the I/O quota
was hit between any two lines, the file ended up TRUNCATED — early
lines (encrypted private key, public key) present, tail (smart/standard
addresses, footer) missing — and the function returned with no signal.
The matching `ImportPrivateKey` requires `len(lines) == 12` exactly,
so a truncated wallet → unimportable with a generic "invalid file
format" message → user with no recourse and may not realise the
failure happened until later recovery attempts. Worst possible failure
mode for a wallet-export operation.

Fix:
- Build the entire 12-line payload in a `strings.Builder` before
  touching the file (atomic in-memory construction, no intermediate
  write points where partial state can land).
- Single all-or-nothing `OutputFile.WriteString(payload)`. On failure:
  `Close` + `os.Remove(FileName)` + return wrapped error.
- Explicit `OutputFile.Sync()` (flush kernel buffers to durable
  storage), then explicit `OutputFile.Close()` with errors checked.
- Function signature: `func(...)` → `func(...) error`.

CLI caller in `process.go::SaveBitString` updated to print to stderr +
`os.Exit(1)` on failure. Tests
(`TestExportPrivateKey_NoLogFatal`, `TestExportPrivateKey_OsCreateErrorBlock_Shape`,
`TestExportPrivateKey_FileCreateFailure_ReturnsError`) updated to pin
the new error-returning shape.

#### F-API-003 — `GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey` returns `(string, error)`

Commit `ee92a1b`. **Go-side breaking change**.

Pre-v4.0.1 the function had two contract violations for a public
library function in the v4.0.0-carved-out `keystore` package:
1. `fmt.Println("Invalid public key format. No dot found.")` from
   inside a library helper — a side-effect that breaks callers running
   in non-CLI contexts (server, GUI, JSON pipe).
2. Returned the magic sentinel string `"InvalidPublicKey.txt"` instead
   of a Go-idiomatic error. Consumers couldn't distinguish a real
   wallet someone deliberately named that from a programming error,
   and `ExportPrivateKey` would have silently produced a wallet file
   literally named `"InvalidPublicKey.txt"`, with multiple failed
   exports colliding on that filename.

Fix: signature changed from `func(string) string` to
`func(string) (string, error)`. Drop the `fmt.Println`. Return a
wrapped error on the no-separator path. Propagate at the one
production caller (`keystore/export.go:72` inside `ExportPrivateKey`).
3 new tests added at `keystore/filename_test.go`.

#### F-API-004 — Wallet parser: header-anchored, CRLF-tolerant, no oracle

Commit `9ed4751`. Pre-v4.0.1 `ImportPrivateKey` split the file content
on `"\n"` and demanded EXACTLY 12 elements, then trusted `lines[2]`
(encrypted PK) and `lines[5]` (public key) by positional index. Two
brittleness vectors:

1. **CRLF normalisation** (Windows clipboard, email transport, git's
   `core.autocrlf=true`) replaced `"\n"` with `"\r\n"`, leaving each
   split part `\r`-terminated. Combined with any tool that "ensures
   final newline" the count drifted off 12 → import rejected with the
   generic "invalid file format" message → cross-platform recovery
   broken for non-trivial reasons.

2. **No header content validation** — a malicious 12-line file (no
   need for valid headers) could be fed to `ImportPrivateKey` to
   attempt password decrypt against `lines[2]`. AES would bail with
   "incorrect password or decryption failed", turning the import
   surface into a brute-force oracle.

Also reported as F-DB-001 by the database-auditor — same bug, two
auditor lenses.

Fix: header-anchored parsing.
- Strip `\r` per-line; trim surrounding whitespace per-line.
- Walk lines to locate canonical headers by content
  (`headerEncryptedPrivateKey`, `headerPublicKey` package constants),
  take the first non-empty subsequent line as the body.
- Headers must match exactly — non-wallet files rejected at the parse
  stage rather than at AES (closes the oracle vector).

5 new tests at `keystore/import_test.go`: round-trip, CRLF tolerance,
trailing-newline tolerance, non-wallet rejection (with explicit
forbid-list assertion catching the AES-fallthrough oracle vector if
ever re-introduced), missing-second-header rejection.

### Library API honesty (`Bitmap/`)

#### F-API-006 — `Bitmap.ValidateBitmap` Godoc no longer claims work it doesn't do

Commit `624d71b`. **Documentation-only fix, no behavior change.**

Pre-v4.0.1 the Godoc summary line read "performs structural validation
of a Bitmap" — misleading, since the function body is `return nil`. A
consumer reading the Godoc would believe the bitmap was being inspected
and might skip their own checks.

The honest body comment was already there ("currently always returns
nil. It exists for API symmetry … and as a hook for future conventions"),
but only Godoc summary lines surface in IDE tooltips and the
`go doc` listing — readers don't see the body.

Fix: rewrite the summary line to make the no-op nature explicit
("ValidateBitmap is a NO-OP that always returns nil"). Expand the body
documentation to explain *why* it's a no-op and stays a no-op:
- The Go type system already enforces the structural invariants
  (`[40][40]bool` cannot be wrong-shape or nil).
- Real "is this a valid DALOS bitmap" checks would have to be
  CURVE-SPECIFIC (DALOS=40×40=1600 bits, APOLLO=32×32=1024 bits,
  LETO=different again). Per-curve dimension checks belong on the
  receiving Ellipse, not on the Bitmap helper.
- Cross-impl note added: TS port's `validateBitmap` returns
  `{ valid: boolean; reason?: string }` and DOES perform structural
  checks because TS lacks Go's compile-time type guarantees. The Go
  side intentionally diverges here.

The single in-repo caller (`GenerateFromBitmap` in
`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go`) gets a comment noting the call is kept as
a forward-compat anchor — any future real check added to ValidateBitmap
will fire automatically without a downstream API change.

Option A (remove the function entirely) and Option B (mirror TS and
make it real) were considered and rejected: removal would break any
external consumer using the symbol; making it real would require
curve-specific dimension parameters that don't belong at this layer.

### Test infrastructure

#### F-TEST-003 — `keystore.AESDecrypt` + `ImportPrivateKey` direct tests + flaky-roundtrip fix

Commit `f906556`. **Test additions + a fix for pre-existing flakiness in F-API-004's roundTripFixture. No production code changes. No byte-identity risk.**

Pre-v4.0.1 the keystore package's public `AESDecrypt` function had ZERO direct tests; it was exercised transitively via `ImportPrivateKey`'s round-trip tests. Specific failure modes (wrong password, malformed ciphertext, post-F-ERR-002 base-49 validation, empty input, too-short ciphertext) weren't pinned. `ImportPrivateKey` itself had round-trip + parser-rejection coverage from F-API-004 but lacked file-not-found and wrong-password unhappy-path tests.

**Test additions (NEW `keystore/aesdecrypt_test.go`):**
- `TestAESDecrypt_RoundTrip` — happy path, 4 sub-cases (short bitstring, Unicode password, long password, corpus bs0001 fixture).
- `TestAESDecrypt_RejectsWrongPassword` — AES-GCM auth-tag-mismatch path.
- `TestAESDecrypt_RejectsMalformedBase49` — F-ERR-002 alphabet-validator rejection at the keystore wrapper layer (`"malformed base-49 ciphertext"` prefix), 4 sub-cases.
- `TestAESDecrypt_RejectsEmpty` — empty-input branch.
- `TestAESDecrypt_RejectsTooShortCiphertext` — AES-side rejection of too-short payloads.
- `TestImportPrivateKey_RejectsFileNotFound` — `os.ReadFile` error propagation.
- `TestImportPrivateKey_RejectsWrongPassword` — canonical `"incorrect password or decryption failed"` wording for end-to-end import.

**Bonus fix: stabilised pre-existing flake in `roundTripFixture` (used by F-API-004 tests).** The `ExportPrivateKey → AES.EncryptBitString → big.Int.Text(2)` path is **lossy whenever the encrypted blob's most-significant byte has its high nibble close to zero** — documented Go-era edge case (CLAUDE.md "Hardening catalogue" / AUDIT.md AES-1+AES-2, NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN). The TS port sidesteps this by constraining the IV's high nibble to be non-zero; the Go side accepts the ~1/16 round-trip failure rate per encryption. F-API-004's `TestImportPrivateKey_AcceptsTrailingNewline` (and the other roundTripFixture-dependent tests) had been latently flaky at ~10-30% failure rate since they shipped.

Both `roundTripFixture` (in `import_test.go`) and the new `encryptForTest` helper (in `aesdecrypt_test.go`) now use a verify-on-success retry pattern: encrypt, attempt the inverse decrypt, retry on failure. Statistically O(1) expected attempts; max attempts capped at 100 (probability of all failing ~ 1e-117).

**Verification:**
- 10/10 consecutive `go test ./keystore/` runs all green (vs 7/10 before the retry-loop fix).
- Full Go suite passes; corpus byte-identity preserved (`v1_genesis.json` SHA `082f7a40...`).
- TS suite unaffected (no TS source touched).

#### F-TEST-002 — Bitmap package: scope docs + comprehensive unit tests

Commit `7ffb43e`. **Doc-only change to source files + new test file. No behavior change. No byte-identity risk.**

Pre-v4.0.1 the Go `Bitmap/` package had ZERO direct unit tests. Correctness rode on the 20 bitmap vectors in `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` end-to-end byte-identity. That catches macroscopic regressions but doesn't cover validators, error-message contracts, roundtrip properties, or the row-major scan-order convention.

Initial proposal was to also refactor the package to support per-curve bitmap dimensions (e.g., APOLLO 32×32 → 1024 bits) since the current code is hardcoded 40×40 → 1600 bits (DALOS-only). Investigation revealed OuronetUI v0.30.12 already solved this with consumer-side dimensioning in `OuronetUI/src/lib/dalos/bitmap-local.ts` — explicitly chosen architectural decision per its docstring: *"Rather than split the core's tight DALOS format, we do the dimension-generic conversions here in the UI layer and feed the results to core's `generateFromBitString`."* Centralizing the dimensioning into this package would have:
- Broken OuronetUI's `import type { Bitmap }` if the type shape changed.
- Broken OuronetCore's Go-side consumers of `Bitmap.Bitmap` as a value type.
- Made `bitmap-local.ts` redundant or silently divergent.
- Forced an npm v4 → v5 major bump for a capability consumers already had at the right layer.

The right boundary is: this package = curve-agnostic crypto math; consumers = curve-aware UX. F-TEST-002 respects that boundary.

**Fix:**

1. **Updated package docstrings on both Go (`Bitmap/Bitmap.go`) and TS (`ts/src/gen1/bitmap.ts`) sides.** New SCOPE NOTE block explicitly documents:
   - The DALOS-only nature of `Bitmap` / `fromBitmap` / `GenerateFromBitmap`.
   - That non-square or non-1600 curves return length-validation errors from downstream `fromBitString`.
   - The reference consumer-side pattern: paint an appropriately-sized grid, convert to a flat row-major bitstring, call `fromBitString` directly. Cross-references `OuronetUI/src/lib/dalos/bitmap-local.ts` as the canonical example.
   - Maintains the existing Genesis-frozen conventions block (bit convention, scan order, greyscale strictness, OPSEC note).

2. **NEW `Bitmap/Bitmap_test.go`** with 9 test functions covering 30+ sub-cases across the public surface:
   - **`TestBitmapToBitString_LengthIsAlwaysBits`** — output is always 1600 chars of `0`/`1`. (3 sub-cases: all-zero, all-one, alternating.)
   - **`TestBitmapToBitString_RowMajorTopLeftFirst`** — single `true` at `[0][1]` produces `"01" + 1598 zeros`. Catches column-major / row-inversion / column-inversion bugs explicitly.
   - **`TestBitmapToBitString_AllZeroAllOne`** — boundary pin against `strings.Repeat("0", 1600)` and the all-ones equivalent.
   - **`TestBitmapToBitString_BitStringToBitmapReveal_RoundTrip`** — bitmap → bits → bitmap is identity. (4 sub-cases including corner pixels.)
   - **`TestBitStringToBitmapReveal_RejectsWrongLength`** — empty / 1599 / 1601 / way-short all rejected with "must be exactly" wording.
   - **`TestBitStringToBitmapReveal_RejectsBadChars`** — `x`/space/`2`/newline at various positions rejected with "invalid char at position" wording.
   - **`TestParseAsciiBitmap_HappyPath`** — checkerboard pattern parses correctly.
   - **`TestParseAsciiBitmap_RejectsMalformedInput`** — table-driven across 7 malformed cases (too-few rows, too-many rows, row-too-short, row-too-long, uppercase invalid char, space invalid char, newline invalid char). Each must mention either "expected 40 rows" or "row N" or "invalid char" in the error.
   - **`TestBitmapToAscii_RoundTripWithParse`** — `ParseAsciiBitmap(BitmapToAscii(b)) == b` for all-zero, all-one, alternating.
   - **`TestEqualBitmap_TrueOnSameFalseOnSinglePixelDiff`** — equality semantics including a single-pixel-different counter-case.

   `ParsePngFileToBitmap` is NOT tested here — requires committing PNG fixture binaries which is a separate spec.

**Verification:**
- `go test ./Bitmap/` clean: 30+ sub-cases all pass in ~10ms.
- Full Go suite still green; corpus byte-identity preserved (`v1_genesis.json` SHA `082f7a40...` unchanged) since no source-code logic was touched.

#### F-TEST-001 — Add Go-side CI workflow + add "adding new primitives" playbook

Commit `efd0fe6`. **CI infrastructure addition + new contributor documentation. No code changes. No byte-identity risk.**

Pre-v4.0.1 the Go reference (the canonical implementation per `CLAUDE.md`) had **no CI automation at all**. The TS port has had `ts-ci.yml` since v3.x; the Go side relied entirely on developers remembering to run `go test` and diff the corpus locally before pushing. A Go-side regression that broke Genesis byte-identity wouldn't be caught until the next manual regen — or, worse, until the TypeScript port's byte-identity tests later failed with a misleading "TS broken" error when actually Go had drifted.

Fix has two pieces:

**(1) NEW workflow `.github/workflows/go-ci.yml`** with 4 gates running on every push to `main` and every PR touching Go code or `testvectors/`:
1. `go build ./...` — compile check
2. `go vet ./...` — static analysis
3. `go test -timeout 120s ./...` — full unit suite
4. **Corpus byte-identity check** — regenerates the three frozen v1_*.json files and asserts their elided SHA-256 matches the canonical baseline:
   - `v1_genesis.json`     `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae`
   - `v1_historical.json`  `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b`
   - `v1_adversarial.json` `b9f228943106e1293c52a7e3d741520e58940b78816a2eeed7aa7332314b9d93`

The byte-identity check is structured so that adding a new primitive's frozen baseline is a one-line edit to a bash associative array — see the playbook below for the procedure. On gate failure, the workflow prints the offending file, expected vs actual SHA, and the first 60 lines of the diff between committed and regenerated content (so a human can debug from the CI log alone).

**(2) NEW document `docs/ADDING_NEW_PRIMITIVES.md`** — the canonical playbook for adding new cryptographic primitives without tripping the byte-identity gate. Sections:

- TL;DR: the 5 rules in one place.
- What the frozen contract actually is (which SHAs, what they cover, what the elision recipe is).
- Invariants you must NOT break (Schnorr v2 wire format, `a=1`, base-49 alphabet, AES KDF, seven-fold Blake3, scalar sizes per curve).
- How CI enforces the contract.
- The 8-step playbook for adding a new primitive: implement Go → add separate generator path → verify Gen-1 still matches → implement TS mirror → cross-validate → freeze + add CI pin → document → register.
- Naming convention for new corpus files.
- "What to do if the SHA gate fires red" — 4-step diagnosis covering the common failure modes (intentional Gen-1 change, shared-helper drift, mixed generator paths, other).
- Related-documents pointers + an "AI agents" section with discipline notes.

**(3) `CLAUDE.md` updated** with a new top-level section pointing to the playbook, so any AI agent loading project context on a future session sees the rules immediately.

**Forward-compat design:** the workflow's `BASELINES` array is the only thing that needs updating when a new primitive is frozen. Adding a future post-quantum primitive (e.g., Dilithium) is one new line in the array + one new file in `testvectors/`. The existing v1 pins stay forever.

### Release pipeline (`.github/workflows/`)

#### F-INT-002 — `ts-publish.yml` race conditions hardened

Commit `a4739d4`. **CI/release-pipeline change. No code changes. No byte-identity risk.**

The TS release pipeline had two real race conditions, one of which you observed during the v4.0.0 release:

1. **Tag-and-merge race.** Pushing a commit to `main` started `ts-ci` across Node 20/22/24 (~2-3 minutes). Pushing the release tag immediately after started `ts-publish` on Node 24 only. If `ts-publish` finished first AND the Node-20 CI build later failed, **a broken-on-Node-20 version was already on npm** with no rollback. Pre-fix `ts-publish` had no dependency on `ts-ci` and only tested Node 24.

2. **Rapid-fire tag re-push.** Force-pushing a tag could spawn parallel `ts-publish` runs that raced on `npm publish` — npm rejected the duplicate but CI minutes were wasted and the GitHub Release page could end up half-formed. Pre-fix `ts-publish` had no `concurrency:` block.

Fix (in `ts-publish.yml`):

1. **Workflow-level `concurrency:` block** — `group: ts-publish-${{ github.ref }}` + `cancel-in-progress: false`. Serialises per-tag runs: a second push waits for the first to complete. `cancel-in-progress: false` is intentional — never cancel a publish mid-flight (half-published packages are worse than a delayed second attempt).

2. **NEW `gates` job with Node 20/22/24 matrix.** Mirrors `ts-ci.yml` exactly: lint + typecheck + build + test + docs:check on each Node version. Runs ON THE TAGGED SHA before the publish job is allowed to start. The `publish` job has `needs: gates`, so a single matrix-cell failure on Node 20 (or 22, or 24) blocks the npm publish + Release creation entirely.

3. **`publish` job de-duplicated.** Since `gates` already runs lint/typecheck/test on all 3 Node versions, the publish job's redundant copies of those steps were removed; only `npm run build` is kept (to produce the artifact for `npm publish`). Net change: faster publish job + same correctness guarantee.

**Bonus fix (closes F-INT-004 as a side effect):** the backfill list at the bottom of the workflow was missing `ts-v4.0.0`. Now includes it. Future tags should be added to the list each release (the audit's F-INT-004 finding noted this drift; addressed inline here rather than as a separate change).

**Verification:**
- YAML structure verified via indent-anchored grep: top-level `name`, `on`, `concurrency`, `permissions`, `jobs` at column 0; `gates` and `publish` at column 2 inside `jobs`; `needs: gates` at column 4 inside `publish`. No tabs, consistent 2-space indent.
- `actionlint` not run (not installed in this environment); the GitHub Actions parser will validate on next push. If it rejects the YAML, fix is mechanical and obvious.

**Real-world impact:** the next release will:
- Block on a Node-20-only test failure before publishing (closes F-INT-002 #1).
- Queue rather than race when re-pushing a tag (closes F-INT-002 #2).
- Backfill `ts-v4.0.0` to GitHub Releases on the next publish run (closes F-INT-004).

### Performance — Schnorr verify hot path

#### F-PERF-001 — Cofactor `[4]·R` and `[4]·P` via two HWCD doublings instead of `ScalarMultiplier(4, _)`

Commit `67d7a35`. **Real perf win, no behavior change, byte-identity preserved.**

Inside `SchnorrVerify` (and its TS twin in both sync + async forms),
the cofactor security check multiplies `R` and `P` by 4 to confirm
they're not in the small (order-4) subgroup. Pre-v4.0.1 this used
`ScalarMultiplier(big.NewInt(4), X)` (Go) / `scalarMultiplier(e.r, X, e)`
(TS), which builds a 48-element PrecomputeMatrix (24 doublings + 24
additions of internal work) and walks the base-49 digits of the
scalar — way over-engineered for the trivial scalar 4.

Mathematical equivalence: `[4]·X = [2·2]·X = doubling(doubling(X))`
holds for any abelian group, including this Twisted Edwards curve.
Both paths produce the same projective point; the `IsInfinityPoint`
boolean fires on the same condition.

Fix: replace at 6 sites total.
- Go (`Elliptic/Schnorr.go`):
  - Line 459 (cofactor check on R): `e.ScalarMultiplier(cofactor4, RExtend)` →
    `e.noErrDoubling(e.noErrDoubling(RExtend))`.
  - Line 486 (cofactor check on P): same pattern on `PExtend`.
  - The package-level `var cofactor4 = big.NewInt(4)` becomes dead
    code and is removed; the explanatory doc-comment block is rewritten
    in-place to document the new doubling-based approach + reference
    the equivalence test.
- TypeScript (`ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`):
  - Line 45 (imports): add `doubling` to the existing `point-ops.js`
    import.
  - Line 410 (sync verify, cofactor on R): `scalarMultiplier(e.r, rExtended, e)` →
    `doubling(doubling(rExtended, e), e)`.
  - Line 430 (sync verify, cofactor on P): same pattern.
  - Line 567 (async verify, cofactor on R): same pattern. Note:
    `doubling` is fast and synchronous — no `await` needed even on
    the async path.
  - Line 586 (async verify, cofactor on P): same pattern.

Perf impact: roughly 16× less big-int work per cofactor step. With R
+ P combined, ~96 wasted big-int ops eliminated per Schnorr verify.
Stacks with F-PERF-003 (8 wasted ModInverses) for ~30-50% expected
reduction in Schnorr verify wall-clock once both land.

Tests added (Go-side, `Elliptic/Schnorr_strict_parser_test.go`):
- `TestCofactor4_DoublingEquivalence` — table-driven, asserts the
  AFFINE projection of `ScalarMultiplier(4, X)` and
  `noErrDoubling(noErrDoubling(X))` matches for 3 distinct on-curve
  points: the generator G, [2]·G, and a corpus-derived public key
  point. Affine equivalence is the canonical check (extended HWCD
  has multiple representations of the same projective point).
- `TestCofactor4_InfinityPreserved` — confirms `IsInfinityPoint` is
  invariant across both paths on a non-infinity input. The
  infinity-side of the check (small-subgroup attack vectors) is
  exercised end-to-end by the corpus generator's adversarial vectors;
  Genesis SHA-256 byte-identity preservation IS the regression guard
  for that direction.

TS-side: no new tests; the TS suite already cross-checks every
deterministic vector against the Go-produced corpus. If the TS
cofactor change diverged behaviorally from Go, the existing byte-identity
assertions in `ts/tests/` would catch it on the next `npm test` run.

Verification:
- `go build ./...` + `go vet ./...` clean.
- Full Go test suite passes (5 packages green).
- Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved (the adversarial
  cofactor vectors in `v1_genesis.json` exercise the infinity branch
  end-to-end):
    `v1_genesis.json`     `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae`
    `v1_historical.json`  `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b`
- TS-side typecheck not run in this environment (npm not on shell
  PATH); user should run `npm run typecheck && npm test` from `ts/`
  before pollinate.

#### F-PERF-003 / F-PERF-004 — `ArePointsEqual` + `IsOnCurve` rewritten on extended coords (Go + TS)

Commit `d8a76d8`. **Real perf win in the Schnorr verify hot path. No behavior change. End-to-end byte-identity preserved across the genesis + historical + adversarial corpora; cross-impl byte-identity confirmed by 426/426 TS tests.**

`SchnorrVerify` was paying **8 modular inverses per verify**:
- `IsOnCurve(R)` → `Extended2Affine` → 2 `ModInverse` calls (one for AX = EX/EZ, one for AY = EY/EZ on the same denominator).
- `IsOnCurve(P)` → same 2 `ModInverse` calls.
- `ArePointsEqual(LeftTerm, RightTerm)` → `Extended2Affine` on BOTH points → 4 `ModInverse` calls total.

Modular inverse is the most expensive single big.Int operation in this codebase (Extended Euclidean Algorithm against a 1606-bit prime; orders of magnitude slower than `Mul`/`Add`/`Mod`). Eliminating 8 per verify is a meaningful hot-path win.

**The math:**

DALOS Twisted Edwards has parameter `a = 1` (verified across all 5 curve definitions in `Parameters.go`), so the affine equation is `x² + y² = 1 + d·x²·y²`. With `x = X/Z`, `y = Y/Z`, `T = XY/Z`, multiplying by `Z²` and using `x²·y² = T²/Z²` (since `T² = X²Y²/Z²`) gives the homogenized extended-coords curve equation:

    X² + Y² ≡ Z² + d·T² (mod p)

(Or for general `a`: `a·X² + Y² ≡ Z² + d·T²`.)

For point equality, two extended points represent the same affine point iff:

    X1·Z2 ≡ X2·Z1 (mod p)  AND  Y1·Z2 ≡ Y2·Z1 (mod p)

(Cross-multiply the affine equality `X1/Z1 == X2/Z2` and `Y1/Z1 == Y2/Z2` by `Z1·Z2`.)

**Cost comparison:**

| Operation | OLD (via `Extended2Affine`) | NEW (projective) | Win |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ArePointsEqual` | 4 `ModInverse` + 4 `Mul` | 4 `Mul` + 2 `Cmp` | **-4 inversions** |
| `IsOnCurve`      | 2 `ModInverse` + ~5 `Mul` + 2 `Add` | 5 `Mul` + 2 `Add` + 1 `Cmp` | **-2 inversions** |
| Per Schnorr verify (R + P + LHS==RHS) | 8 `ModInverse` | 0 `ModInverse` | **-8 inversions** |

**Implementation strategy (proof-first):**

1. Added private helpers `arePointsEqualProjective` + `isOnCurveExtended` to `Elliptic/PointOperations.go` alongside the unchanged public methods.
2. Added an extensive equivalence test suite in NEW file `Elliptic/PointOperations_perf_equiv_test.go`:
   - **`TestArePointsEqual_OldVsNew_Equivalence`** (3 sub-tests):
     - `same_point_self`: every point compares equal to itself in BOTH paths.
     - `same_projective_different_extended`: the cryptographically load-bearing case. Each base point is rescaled by 10 different non-zero factors (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29); each scaled extended representation projects to the same affine point. Both paths must return TRUE for the rescaled-vs-original pairs. Pre-fix this would have broken if `arePointsEqualProjective` failed to see through the Z-scaling. ✓ All passed.
     - `different_points`: full N×N cross-pair consistency check on 12 distinct on-curve points (G, [2]·G, [3]·G, [4]·G, a corpus-derived public key, and 7 scaled-G representations). Both paths return identical booleans on every pair. ✓
   - **`TestIsOnCurve_OldVsNew_Equivalence`** (3 sub-tests):
     - `on_curve_inputs`: 12 on-curve inputs; both paths return `(true, false)`. ✓
     - `off_curve_inputs`: 5 off-curve inputs `(1,1), (2,3), (5,7), (1,0), (0,0)`; both return `(false, false)`. ✓
     - `infinity_canonical`: HWCD canonical infinity `(0, 1, 1, 0)`; both return `(true, true)`. ✓
   - **`TestSchnorrVerify_RoundTrip_Corpus`**: end-to-end sign+verify on 5 messages including empty-string and a long phrase. ✓
3. Once equivalence proven on synthetic + corpus-derived inputs, swapped the public method bodies (`ArePointsEqual`, `IsOnCurve`) to delegate to the new helpers.
4. Re-ran full Go test suite **3 consecutive times** — all packages pass. ✓
5. Re-ran the corpus generator and verified **byte-identity SHA-256 preserved** on all three corpora:
   - `v1_genesis.json`     `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae` (unchanged since v3.0.0)
   - `v1_historical.json`  `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b` (unchanged since v3.0.0)
   - `v1_adversarial.json` `b9f228943106e1293c52a7e3d741520e58940b78816a2eeed7aa7332314b9d93` (matches committed baseline byte-for-byte)
6. Applied the same fix to TS port (`ts/src/gen1/curve.ts`): rewrote `isOnCurve` and `arePointsEqual` with the projective formulas. Note: TS keeps `m.mul(e.a, x2)` (vs Go's implicit `a=1`) because `e.a` is a curve parameter potentially varying across LETO/ARTEMIS/APOLLO; for DALOS `e.a === 1n` so the multiplication reduces to identity at runtime. TS `isInverseOnCurve` (separate from the Schnorr verify hot path) was deliberately NOT touched — same scope discipline as F-PERF-001.

**Critical security note: adversarial cofactor vectors STILL get rejected.** The `v1_adversarial.json` corpus contains 5 vectors:
- 4 with `expected_verify_result: false` (small-subgroup attack vectors that MUST be rejected by the cofactor + on-curve checks).
- 1 with `expected_verify_result: true` (legitimate control).

The corpus generator runs `SchnorrVerify` on each vector and writes both `expected_verify_result` (the spec) and `verify_actual` (what verify said). If F-PERF-003 had introduced any behavioral divergence — e.g., the new `IsOnCurve` accepting an off-curve point that the old one rejected — `verify_actual` would have flipped for at least one vector and the elided SHA-256 would have diverged from the committed baseline. **The fact that the elided SHA matches byte-for-byte is the strongest possible end-to-end empirical proof: the new helpers produce identical verify outcomes across every adversarial vector in the corpus.**

**Files touched:**
- `Elliptic/PointOperations.go`: added `arePointsEqualProjective` + `isOnCurveExtended` helpers; rewrote `ArePointsEqual` + `IsOnCurve` bodies to delegate to them.
- `Elliptic/PointOperations_perf_equiv_test.go`: NEW file. ~240 lines of equivalence proofs.
- `ts/src/gen1/curve.ts`: rewrote `arePointsEqual` + `isOnCurve` bodies. Comments updated.

**TS-side full validation passed:**
- `npm run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit): clean, no errors.
- `npm test` (vitest): **all 426 tests pass across 19 test files.**
- Critical cross-impl byte-identity assertions all green:
  - `schnorrSign (BYTE-IDENTITY vs Go corpus)`: all 20 Schnorr vectors produce byte-identical signatures.
  - `schnorrVerify — accepts all 20 committed signatures`: ✓
  - `schnorrSignAsync / schnorrVerifyAsync — equivalence with sync`: async path byte-identical to sync.
  - `fromBitString / fromSeedWords / fromBitmap (BYTE-IDENTITY END-TO-END vs Go corpus)`: all 50 + 15 + 20 deterministic vectors reproduce.
  - `BYTE-IDENTITY: APOLLO historical corpus`: all 5 APOLLO Schnorr vectors reproduce signature byte-for-byte and verify true.

This is the strongest possible cross-impl proof: the TS port — with the F-PERF-001 cofactor doublings AND the F-PERF-003 projective `arePointsEqual` + `isOnCurve` rewrites — produces byte-identical Schnorr signatures and verify results matching the Go-produced corpus across all 105 + 30 + 5 = 140 deterministic vectors. If either Go or TS had drifted behaviourally on the optimized paths, these byte-identity assertions would have failed immediately.

**Per-test latency observation:** the post-fix TS Schnorr verify suite (`schnorrVerify — accepts all 20 committed signatures`) ran in 4618ms (~230ms/verify on this machine). Pre-fix baseline isn't recorded but the perf delta is in the right direction; future benchmarks could quantify the speed-up explicitly.

### Library API hardening (`Elliptic/`)

#### F-ERR-002 — `ConvertBase49toBase10` alphabet validator + error return

Commit `efa59ec`. **Go-side breaking change**.

Pre-v4.0.1 the helper discarded `(*big.Int).SetString`'s `ok` return.
Per Go docs, the value of the result is *undefined* on parse failure
but the pointer is still returned, producing garbage that flowed
unchecked into `SchnorrSign`, `AESDecrypt`, and the Schnorr signature
parser.

Cross-impl parity gap: the TS port's `parseBigIntInBase`
(`ts/src/gen1/hashing.ts`) was hardened in REQ-21 to throw on invalid
base-49 chars. The Go side never received the matching fix until now.

Fix:
1. Add `IsValidBase49Char(c byte) bool` exported helper in
   `Elliptic/PointOperations.go` (mirrors TS `isValidBase49Char`).
2. Refactor `ConvertBase49toBase10` to return `(*big.Int, error)`:
   - empty input → error
   - any byte outside base-49 alphabet → error (names offending byte)
   - SetString failure → error (defense-in-depth)
3. Propagate at 4 production call sites with existing error returns
   (Schnorr.go:103, 143, 147; keystore/decrypt.go:18). The 5th call
   site in `SchnorrSign` initially used the empty-string sentinel
   pattern; that branch was refactored to a proper error in F-API-005.

4 new tests added at `Elliptic/Schnorr_strict_parser_test.go`.

#### F-ERR-003 — `PublicKeyToAddress` + `AffineToPublicKey` panic on malformed input

Commit `f04dae9`. Two latent crash/silent-corruption vectors in the
address-derivation helpers, sister functions to F-ERR-002:

`PublicKeyToAddress` (`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:44-54`):
1. `SplitString[1]` without length check → obscure index-out-of-range
   panic on input lacking the dot separator.
2. `(*big.Int).SetString(_, 49)` discarded the ok return → malformed
   base-49 input silently produced an undefined `*big.Int` that flowed
   through the seven-fold Blake3 chain into a "valid-looking" 160-char
   address bearing no relation to any real key.

`AffineToPublicKey` (`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:91-105`):
3. Nil `AX`/`AY` (zero-value `CoordAffine` reaching the function) →
   obscure "runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer
   dereference" on the first `.String()` call.

Fix: panic-at-entry with explicit messages naming the function and
offending field/condition. Matches the FP-001 / PO-3 / KG-3 fail-fast
convention and the TS port's throw-on-malformed-input behaviour.
Panic chosen over error-return because `DalosAddressMaker` has 11+
production callers (CLI flow + corpus generator) and changing the
return signature would ripple widely.

`PublicKeyToAddress` now uses the new `ConvertBase49toBase10` from
F-ERR-002 — closes the v4.0.1 hardening cluster end-to-end. 4 new
tests added (table-driven for the `AffineToPublicKey` nil cases).

#### F-ERR-007 — `SchnorrSign` range-check parsed private key

Commit `2d25469`. `SchnorrSign` computes `s = z + e·k mod Q`. Pre-v4.0.1
there was no check that the parsed `k` was in `[1, Q-1]`. The dangerous
case is `k = 0`:

  R = 0·G = O (point at infinity)
  s = z + e·0 mod Q = z

Result: a structurally-valid signature is emitted where R is infinity
and s == z — the signer's deterministic nonce is now public, embedded
in the signature.

Cross-impl parity: TS `schnorrSign` at `ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts:317-360`
has equivalent guards via `parseBigIntInBase` + range validation
(REQ-21 + REQ-22).

Fix: 3-line range check immediately after the F-ERR-002 parse:

    if k.Sign() <= 0 || k.Cmp(&e.Q) >= 0 {
        return ""
    }

The `return ""` was later refactored to a proper error in F-API-005.
3 new tests (k=0, k=Q, k=Q+1, plus a happy-path positive control).

#### F-API-005 — `SchnorrSign` returns `(string, error)`

Commit `3dfc186`. **Go-side breaking change.**

Pre-v4.0.1 `SchnorrSign` returned `string`. Three internal-failure
conditions silently returned `""`:
- Malformed PRIV (added in F-ERR-002)
- `k` out of `[1, Q-1]` (added in F-ERR-007)
- Nil Fiat-Shamir challenge (original)

The CLI driver at `Dalos.go:284` printed the empty string under a
"Your Signature is:" banner with no detection. Pipe consumers
(`dalos -sign ... > sig.txt`) silently got an empty file.

Cross-language divergence: TS `schnorrSign` (`ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`)
throws `SchnorrSignError` on the same conditions. Go was the lone
surface still using a magic-empty-string sentinel.

Fix: signature changed to `(string, error)`. All three internal
failures now return descriptive errors via `fmt.Errorf`. Updated:
- `EllipseMethods` interface in `Elliptic/PointOperations.go:59`
  (Phase 11 compile-time conformance assertion).
- CLI caller `Dalos.go:284` → stderr + `os.Exit(1)`.
- 3 corpus-generator call sites in `testvectors/generator/main.go` →
  `must(err, ...)` (build-time tool; failing there is correct).
- 5 adversarial-test call sites + 4 strict-parser test call sites
  updated to handle the new return type.

1 new test (`TestSchnorrSign_RejectsMalformedPRIV`) added; the 3
existing F-ERR-007 tests updated to assert on `err != nil` instead of
the legacy empty-string sentinel.

### Verification

For every fix in this draft:
- `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` clean.
- Full test suite passes (5 Go packages green).
- Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved at extended-elided
  SHA-256:
  - `v1_genesis.json`     `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae`
  - `v1_historical.json`  `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b`

### Migration notes (Go-reference consumers only)

If you embed the Go reference directly (`import "DALOS_Crypto/Elliptic"`
or `"DALOS_Crypto/keystore"`), update call sites for the signature
changes:

```go
// v4.0.0
filename := keystore.GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey(publicKey)
err := keystore.ExportPrivateKey(e, bitString, password) // was: no return
sig := e.SchnorrSign(keyPair, message)
bigVal := el.ConvertBase49toBase10(s)

// v4.0.1
filename, err := keystore.GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey(publicKey)
if err != nil { /* handle malformed PUBL */ }

if err := keystore.ExportPrivateKey(e, bitString, password); err != nil {
    /* handle disk-full / partial-write / sync / close failure */
}

sig, err := e.SchnorrSign(keyPair, message)
if err != nil { /* handle malformed PRIV / k out-of-range / etc. */ }

bigVal, err := el.ConvertBase49toBase10(s)
if err != nil { /* handle malformed base-49 input */ }
```

The TypeScript package `@stoachain/dalos-crypto` is unaffected — no TS
public surface changed in v4.0.1.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-05-03

**M3 BREAKING release (major).** Closes the `unified-audit-2026-04-29` audit cycle in 11 sequenced phases plus a merge of the parallel v3.1.0 high-additive bundle. Three milestones combined into a single major rather than three separate releases (M1 medium → would-be v3.2.0, M2 low → would-be v3.2.1, M3 architecture → forces v4.0.0): the M3 Elliptic-package carve-out is the load-bearing reason for the major bump. **426/426 TS tests + 5 Go packages all green.** Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved at extended-elided SHA-256 = `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae` (unchanged since v3.0.0); historical SHA-256 = `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b` (unchanged since v3.0.0).

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Go reference — `Elliptic/` package carve-out (Phase 10, REQ-31, F-ARCH-001)

The historical `DALOS_Crypto/Elliptic` package mixed three concerns under one boundary: pure crypto, wallet I/O, CLI orchestration. Library consumers wanting just the crypto primitives transitively pulled in `os`, `fmt`, AES, and the interactive-stdin code path. v4.0.0 carves it into three surfaces:

- **`Elliptic/`** retains pure-crypto only — curve, point ops, scalar mult, key-gen math, address derivation, Schnorr. 1017 → 664 lines (-353). No `os.*` calls in non-test source; no `fmt.Scanln`; only 3 plan-allowed `fmt.Println` diagnostics inside `ValidatePrivateKey`.
- **`keystore/`** (NEW package, sibling of `AES/`, `Bitmap/`, `Blake3/`) — receives wallet I/O: `ExportPrivateKey`, `ImportPrivateKey`, `AESDecrypt`, `GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey`. Strict one-way dep: `keystore → Elliptic + AES`. Never reverse.
- **`main`** (CLI orchestration in NEW `print.go` + `process.go` alongside `Dalos.go`) — receives CLI orchestration: `PrintKeys`, `PrintPrivateKey`, `ProcessIntegerFlag`, `ProcessPrivateKeyConversion`, `ProcessKeyGeneration`, `SaveBitString`.

10 symbols moved. Receivers rewritten from `(e *Ellipse)` methods to free functions taking `e *el.Ellipse` first parameter — Go forbids defining methods on types from external packages. **The carve-out is output-preserving by construction**: no function bodies changed, only package binding + receiver-to-free-function rewrite.

**Consumer migration (full table in `.bee/specs/2026-05-02-unified-audit-2026-04-29/phases/10-elliptic-package-carve-out/MIGRATION.md`):**

```go
// v3.x
import el "DALOS_Crypto/Elliptic"
DalosEllipse.ExportPrivateKey(BitString, password)
DalosEllipse.ProcessKeyGeneration(BitString, smartFlag, password)
keyPair, err := DalosEllipse.ImportPrivateKey(walletPath, password)
plaintext, err := el.AESDecrypt(ciphertext, password)
filename := el.GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey(keyPair.PUBL)

// v4.0.0
import (
    el "DALOS_Crypto/Elliptic"
    "DALOS_Crypto/keystore"
)
keystore.ExportPrivateKey(&DalosEllipse, BitString, password)
ProcessKeyGeneration(&DalosEllipse, BitString, smartFlag, password)
keyPair, err := keystore.ImportPrivateKey(&DalosEllipse, walletPath, password)
plaintext, err := keystore.AESDecrypt(ciphertext, password)
filename := keystore.GenerateFilenameFromPublicKey(keyPair.PUBL)
```

The `EllipseMethods` interface in `Elliptic/PointOperations.go` is trimmed of 5 declarations (`ProcessIntegerFlag`, `ProcessPrivateKeyConversion`, `ProcessKeyGeneration`, `SaveBitString`, `ExportPrivateKey`) per the carve-out. A new section-VII breadcrumb comment points readers to `../keystore/`.

#### Go reference — `EllipseMethods.SchnorrVerify` parameter order aligned (Phase 11, REQ-32, F-ARCH-002)

Pre-v4.0.0 the interface declaration was `SchnorrVerify(Signature, PublicKey, Message string) bool`. The implementation in `Elliptic/Schnorr.go` always declared `(Signature, Message, PublicKey string) bool`. The interface declaration is now aligned to the implementation's canonical order.

**Migration impact: ZERO in-repo migration needed.** All 9 in-repo `.SchnorrVerify(...)` call sites already pass arguments in canonical `(sig, msg, key)` order. External consumers who dispatch through the `EllipseMethods` interface type (rather than calling the method directly on `*Ellipse`) update their call sites — per repo-wide grep at release time, ZERO such consumers exist in this repo or its known dependents.

A new `Elliptic/assertions.go` file adds compile-time conformance enforcement:

```go
var _ EllipseMethods = (*Ellipse)(nil)
```

Any future drift in TYPE SIGNATURES (parameter types, return types, method names, additions/removals) causes `go build ./Elliptic/...` to fail. The check does NOT detect parameter-name drift (Go's structural typing doesn't include parameter names) — for parameter-name hygiene, the next `/bee:audit` cycle remains the safety net. Filename note: deliberately `assertions.go` not `_assertions.go` (Go's build tool ignores files starting with `.` or `_`).

#### TypeScript port — `Modular` field structural property + `validateBitString` shape (Phases 5 + 9)

- **Phase 5 (REQ-13, F-ARCH-004):** the `Ellipse` interface gained a `readonly field: Modular` structural property (populated at construction time). Functions across `gen1/` no longer take `m: Modular = DALOS_FIELD` default-param — `e.field` is the canonical access pattern. The `DALOS_FIELD` module-level singleton was eliminated as a footgun (it baked DALOS_ELLIPSE.p into every default-arg call site, silently using the wrong field for non-DALOS curves). **External consumers: no observable change** — the `*Async` consumer surfaces still accept the same arguments; internal arithmetic helpers dropped the redundant `m` parameter. Custom-curve consumers gain correct field-derivation per curve.
- **Phase 9 (REQ-28, F-ARCH-006):** `BitStringValidation` interface extended with optional `reason?: string` field (shape parity with `PrivateKeyValidation` and `validateBitmap`). `validateBitString` now ALWAYS runs the structure walk regardless of length-check outcome (Go-parity per `Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:190-208 ValidateBitString` — both booleans reflect actual measurements). `generateScalarFromBitString` rewritten to call the validator exactly once and source the `reason` directly. **External consumers: error message now strictly more informative** (sources from a real field instead of a dead `${reason ? ...}` placeholder); shape is additive (the `reason?` field is optional, existing destructure patterns continue to work).

### Added

#### Test coverage + CI gate (Phase 1, REQ-01-08, REQ-38)

- **`ts/tests/gen1/key-gen.test.ts`** — 3 boundary-scalar tests pinning observed `validatePrivateKey` behavior at Q boundaries (REQ-01).
- **`ts/tests/gen1/bitmap.test.ts`** — 3 rejection tests covering invalid bitmap shapes.
- **`ts/tests/gen1/aes.test.ts`** — 4 rejection-cases tests (REQ-03, F-TEST-004 odd-nibble bitstring round-trip).
- **`ts/tests/ci-workflow/docs-check-step.test.ts`** — pins the docs:check CI step ordering relative to the test step + dist upload.
- **CI coverage gate** (`.github/workflows/ts-ci.yml` Coverage step gated to Node 24) — Vitest coverage thresholds: lines ≥ 80, functions ≥ 80, branches ≥ 75, statements ≥ 80. Enforced by `@vitest/coverage-v8@2.1.9`.

#### Go reference — error-handling regression locks (Phase 2, REQ-09)

- **`AES/BitStringToHex_doc_test.go`** (NEW) — regression-lock test for the BitStringToHex docstring documenting odd-nibble truncation behavior.
- **`Elliptic/QuoModulus_test.go`** (NEW) — 4 tests including `TestQuoModulus_BEqualsModulus_Panics` (F-001 fix: nil-guard panic with descriptive message instead of obscure runtime error).

#### Schnorr cofactor hardening (Phase 6, REQ-15-19, F-SEC-001)

- **`Elliptic/Schnorr.go`** — cofactor subgroup-membership check on R and P components (`[4]·R ≠ O`, `[4]·P ≠ O`) immediately after the existing `IsOnCurve` checks. Rejects order-4 small-subgroup attack signatures the pre-Phase-6 verifier accepted.
- **`Elliptic/Schnorr_strict_parser_test.go`** (NEW) — 4 tests pinning the strict pubkey parser (T6.5, F-SEC-002 / F-ERR-006).
- **`Elliptic/Schnorr_adversarial_test.go`** (NEW + later merged with origin's v3.1.0 SC-5 perturbation tests) — combined Phase 6 cofactor adversarial tests + origin's SC-5 off-curve perturbation tests in a single file. Two test families now coexist as distinct describe sections covering Layers 2 (`IsOnCurve`) + 3 (cofactor check) of the multi-layer-defence chain.
- **`testvectors/v1_adversarial.json`** (NEW) — 5 adversarial cofactor vectors (4 attacks + 1 control); generated reproducibly by `testvectors/generator/main.go`.
- **TS port** — same cofactor checks added to `ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts` `schnorrVerify` AND `schnorrVerifyAsync` (the async variant predated Phase 6 in origin's v3.1.0; the merge preserved Phase 6's hardening + applied it to async for security parity).
- **`ts/tests/gen1/schnorr.test.ts`** — adversarial cofactor corpus describe block with 5 vector-driven tests via the `adversarialCofactorVectors()` fixture loader.

#### Cross-impl error-path consistency (Phase 7, REQ-20-22)

- **`ts/src/gen1/scalar-mult.ts`** — `isValidBase49Char` exported helper. Used by `validatePrivateKey` (REQ-20) and `parseBigIntInBase` (REQ-21) to reject mixed-validity inputs at the earliest boundary, naming the offending character.
- **`ts/src/gen1/key-gen.ts`** — `validatePrivateKey` walks input via `isValidBase49Char` BEFORE the accumulation loop (silent-zero accumulation pre-Phase-7 produced misleading "core bits length" errors for what was really an "invalid base-49 character" cause).
- **Go-side parser symmetry (REQ-22):** `Elliptic/Schnorr.go` `ConvertPublicKeyToAffineCoords` rewritten from `SplitN` to `Split` with `len(parts) != 2` reject + descriptive error. Matches the TS port's strict-parse semantics.

#### TS gen1 consistency + historical re-exports (Phase 9, REQ-27-30)

- **`ts/src/historical/index.ts`** — re-exports `Modular`, `ZERO`, `ONE`, `TWO`, `bytesToBigIntBE`, `bigIntToBytesBE`, `parseBase10` from `gen1/math.js`. Discoverability parity with the registry/* subpath: consumers can now `import { Modular, LETO } from '@stoachain/dalos-crypto/historical'` without dual-importing.

#### Public API ergonomic re-exports (Phase 3, REQ-12)

- **`ts/src/index.ts`** — added `export * as historical` + `export * as blake3` namespace re-exports. Previously dead `SCAFFOLD_VERSION` constant removed.

### Changed

#### Architecture cleanup (Phase 5)

- **`ts/src/gen1/curve.ts`** — `Ellipse` interface gained `readonly field: Modular` structural property. All 4 curve factories populated `field` at construction (DALOS_ELLIPSE + LETO + ARTEMIS + APOLLO).
- **`ts/src/gen1/point-ops.ts`** (10 call sites), **`ts/src/gen1/scalar-mult.ts`** (2 call sites), **`ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`** + **`key-gen.ts`** (8 consumer call site updates) — dropped `m: Modular = DALOS_FIELD` default-param across the gen1 layer; helpers derive `m` internally from the curve's `e.field`.
- **`Elliptic/Schnorr.go`** — deleted ~36 lines of dead helpers (`BinaryStringToBytes` + `Hash2BigInt`, both rendered unused by Schnorr v2 wire-format finalization in v2.0.0).
- **TS-side** — 7 historical/registry files unified to a single canonical "production primitives as of v3.0.0+" status JSDoc.

#### Algorithm refactor (Phase 9, REQ-29, F-PERF-007)

- **`ts/src/gen1/scalar-mult.ts`** `bigIntToBase49` refactored from O(n²) string-prepend to O(n) array-push + reverse + join. Byte-identical output for every input (proven by 500-iter round-trip + Q² huge-scalar reference test). ~47× faster on Q-sized scalars; visible on every `schnorrSign`/`schnorrVerify` call.

#### Symbol consolidation (Phase 9, REQ-27)

- **`ts/src/gen1/key-gen.ts`** — deleted local non-exported `digitValueBase49` copy; canonical version imported from `./scalar-mult.js`. Stale "Imported lazily to avoid circular deps" comment removed (the dep was never circular — `key-gen.ts` already imports from `./scalar-mult.js`).

### Performance

- **Phase 4 (REQ-09-12):** `Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go` `CharacterMatrix` cache (built once at package init via `makeCharacterMatrix`; eliminates the per-call rebuild of 256 rune literals); bulk `rand.Read` in `GenerateRandomBitsOnCurve` (single 200-byte syscall rather than per-byte loop).
- **Phase 4 (TS):** `ts/package.json` `files` array tightened to explicit globs (`["dist/**/*.js", "dist/**/*.d.ts", ...]`) so the npm tarball excludes incidental sources; Vitest timeouts on the slowest tests pulled from 60s/120s down to 30s.
- **Phase 9 (TS, REQ-29):** `bigIntToBase49` O(n²) → O(n), as above.
- **From v3.1.0 (now also active in v4.0.0):** Generator-precompute matrix cache (Go `sync.Once` + TS `WeakMap`); per-curve `Modular` cache (TS port — Phase 5's `e.field` structural property supersedes the v3.1.0 `getModularFor` WeakMap with the same per-curve instance semantics); async wrappers (`scalarMultiplierAsync`, `schnorrSignAsync`, `schnorrVerifyAsync`) yielding to the event loop every 8 outer-loop iterations on a fixed data-independent cadence (browser INP < 200 ms target met).

### Hardened

#### Schnorr (Phase 6 / Cat-A & Cat-B continuation)

- **F-SEC-001 cofactor subgroup-membership check** on R and P (Go + TS, sync + async). Rejects order-4 small-subgroup attack constructions.
- **F-SEC-002 strict pubkey parser** (Go) — `ConvertPublicKeyToAffineCoords` now rejects `xLength < 1`, captures the ok-flag from both `big.Int.SetString` calls, and returns `CoordAffine{}` on any failure.

#### Cross-impl error symmetry (Phase 7)

- **REQ-20:** TS `validatePrivateKey` now walks input via `isValidBase49Char` and rejects mixed-validity base-49 inputs at the earliest boundary, naming the offending character.
- **REQ-21:** TS `parseBigIntInBase` throws on first invalid char (was: silent accumulation as digit 0).
- **REQ-22:** Go `ConvertPublicKeyToAffineCoords` strict 2-part split (was: lenient `SplitN`).

### Removed

- **TS `SCAFFOLD_VERSION` constant** (Phase 3) — was a placeholder from the early scaffold; never referenced post-Genesis-port.
- **Go `Elliptic.BinaryStringToBytes` + `Hash2BigInt`** (Phase 5) — dead since the v2.0.0 Schnorr v2 wire-format finalization.
- **Phase 8 dead-code + stale-docs cleanup:** stale Schnorr-randomness comments updated to v2.0.0+ RFC-6979-style determinism (`testvectors/generator/main.go`); `ts/tsconfig.json` removed unused `"types": ["node"]` injection (full DOM-lib hygienic isolation deferred to a future cycle — see `.bee/false-positives.md` FP-003).

### Verified

- **Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved** at extended-elided SHA-256 = `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae` (post-v2.0.0 baseline; same hash held since v3.0.0 through v3.1.0 and now v4.0.0).
- **Historical 60-vector corpus byte-identity preserved** at extended-elided SHA-256 = `80c93f4d4956e01236808f81f518d17eeaad431f4fedb7c26233d2508f06e68b` (since v3.0.0).
- **All 50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap + 20 Schnorr deterministic records** byte-identical to the v3.1.0 corpus.
- **All 5 adversarial cofactor records** verify with their pre-computed `expected_verify_result` under both Go and TS.
- **Compile-time interface conformance assertion live** (`Elliptic/assertions.go`) — `*Ellipse` satisfies `EllipseMethods` enforced by `go build`. Live-fire mutation test (substituting `(*string)(nil)` for `(*Ellipse)(nil)`) reproduces the expected "*string does not implement EllipseMethods" build failure.
- **TS test suite:** 366 (v3.0.x) → 388 (v3.1.0) → 426 (v4.0.0) — net +60 tests across the audit cycle.
- **Go test suite:** 5 packages all green (DALOS_Crypto root + AES + Auxilliary + Elliptic + new keystore).

### Doc/Audit

- **AUDIT.md** updated with closure rows for all 11 audit-cycle phases (REQ-01 through REQ-32 marked closed at v4.0.0).
- **`.bee/specs/2026-05-02-unified-audit-2026-04-29/phases/10-elliptic-package-carve-out/MIGRATION.md`** — full carve-out migration table with before/after consumer code.
- **`.bee/specs/2026-05-02-unified-audit-2026-04-29/phases/10-elliptic-package-carve-out/SYMBOLS.md`** — 10-symbol relocation authority + EllipseMethods interface enumeration + test-file disposition.
- **`ts/README.md`** — ESM-only blockquote in Install section (clarifies CommonJS `require()` will fail with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`); PNG-omission inline comment in Quick-start (TS port intentionally omits the Go reference's `ParsePngFileToBitmap` helper); test count badge bumped 346 → 426; "RFC-6979" → "RFC-6979-style" terminology fix throughout.

### Publish-pipeline hygiene (folded forward from v3.1.0 Unreleased)

- **GitHub Releases backfilled.** All 8 prior `ts-v*` tags (`ts-v1.0.0`, `ts-v1.1.0`, `ts-v1.2.0`, `ts-v3.0.0`, `ts-v3.0.1`, `ts-v3.0.2`, `ts-v3.0.3`, `ts-v3.1.0`) have GitHub Release pages, populated from each tag's annotation body plus the matching CHANGELOG section. Display titles drop the `ts-` prefix for clean reading on the Releases page; the underlying tag retains the prefix for git-side disambiguation against the Go-reference `v*` tags.
- **`.github/workflows/ts-publish.yml` patched** for the 2026-04-30 gh-CLI flag-incompatibility (`--notes-from-tag` + `--repo` no longer supported on GitHub-hosted runners). Backfill list enumerates all `ts-v*` tags. **npm provenance enabled** (`id-token: write` permission + `--provenance` flag on `npm publish`) — v4.0.0 publishes carry an SLSA attestation linking the npm package back to the GitHub Action run that produced it. npmjs.com displays a "Provenance" badge on the package page.
- **`/bee:pollinate` command** added to the user-global Bee plugin commands. Post-ship publishing pipeline: pushes to origin/main, creates the annotated tag from CHANGELOG content, monitors the CI publish workflow, falls back to REST-API Release creation if the gh-release step fails, verifies the npm registry + provenance, backfills missing prior Releases.
- **`.bee/config.json` lifecycle block** wires DALOS_Crypto into the pollinate flow: `npm_dir: "ts"`, `tag_pattern: "ts-v{version}"`, `release_title_pattern: "v{version}"`, `use_provenance: true`. v4.0.0 publishes through `/bee:pollinate` end-to-end.

### Migration Guide

#### Go consumers

The two BREAKING changes on the Go side are the `Elliptic/` carve-out (Phase 10) and the `EllipseMethods.SchnorrVerify` parameter-order alignment (Phase 11). The carve-out is the load-bearing one; the SchnorrVerify alignment is a documentation/godoc-level change.

**Carve-out migration:** see `.bee/specs/2026-05-02-unified-audit-2026-04-29/phases/10-elliptic-package-carve-out/MIGRATION.md` for the full 10-symbol table. Summary: import `DALOS_Crypto/keystore` for wallet I/O; rewrite `DalosEllipse.X(...)` method calls to `X(&DalosEllipse, ...)` free-function form for the 6 method-bound symbols (`ProcessIntegerFlag`, `ProcessPrivateKeyConversion`, `ProcessKeyGeneration`, `SaveBitString`, `ExportPrivateKey`, `ImportPrivateKey`).

**SchnorrVerify alignment:** zero migration needed if you call `*Ellipse.SchnorrVerify(...)` directly (Go's structural typing preserves call-site argument order). Only matters if you dispatched through the `EllipseMethods` interface type. Per repo-wide grep at release time, no in-repo or known-external consumer does this.

#### TypeScript consumers

No BREAKING surface changes. The `Modular` field structural property (Phase 5) and the `validateBitString` `reason` field (Phase 9) are additive. `bigIntToBase49`'s O(n²) → O(n) refactor is byte-identical for every input. New ergonomic re-exports in `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/historical` (`Modular`, `ZERO`, `ONE`, `TWO`, etc.) save the dual-import for historical-curve consumers.

The v3.1.0 throw-contract change (`schnorrSign` throws `SchnorrSignError` on internal failure rather than returning `""`) is retained in v4.0.0 — see [v3.1.0 Migration Guide](#310--2026-05-02) for the full pattern.

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-05-02

**High-additive bundle (minor).** Closes three additive HIGH-severity audit findings (F-TEST-001 SC-5 regression coverage, F-PERF-001 generator-precompute cache, F-PERF-004 async signing surface) plus one consumer-observable behavior change (F-API-001 typed `SchnorrSignError` throw on internal failure) bundled into a single coordinated minor release. The throw contract is the SOLE consumer-observable behavior change and the reason for the minor bump rather than a patch. **~388/388 TS tests pass** (366 baseline + new SC-5 rejection-cases + PM-cache instrumentation + async-surface watchdog + REQ-14 yield-count constant-time + T3.5 forced-failure tests).

### Added

- **`scalarMultiplierAsync`** — exported from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`. Async wrapper over `scalarMultiplier` that yields to the event loop every 8 outer-loop iterations on a fixed data-independent cadence.
- **`schnorrSignAsync`** — exported from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`. Async wrapper over `schnorrSign` for browser-friendly signing without blocking the event loop. Throws `SchnorrSignError` on internal failure (same condition as sync surface).
- **`schnorrVerifyAsync`** — exported from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`. Async wrapper over `schnorrVerify`. Yields on the same fixed cadence as the sign path.
- **`SchnorrSignError`** — typed exception class exported from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`. Importable for `instanceof` catch blocks. Thrown on internal sign failure (Fiat-Shamir challenge derivation null-result).
- **`ts/tests/gen1/schnorr.test.ts`** — 2 new TS rejection-cases tests for off-curve R (line 255) + off-curve P (line 268) (Phase 1 SC-5 regression coverage).
- **`Elliptic/Schnorr_adversarial_test.go`** — new Go-side adversarial test file with mutation-test verification (off-curve R, off-curve P, scalar-out-of-range, identity-point edge cases).
- **PM-cache instrumentation tests** — Go-side pointer-equality assertion (same `*Ellipse` returns same precompute matrix pointer across calls) and TS-side spy counter (verifies `precomputeMatrix` factory is called exactly once per `Ellipse` instance across N sign+verify cycles).
- **Async-surface watchdog test** — event-loop responsiveness verified via per-yield `performance.now()` instrumentation (NOT `Promise.race` against an arbitrary timeout — condition-based to avoid CI flakes). Asserts no single sync slice exceeds the INP budget.
- **REQ-14 mechanical guard** — yield-count constant-time test: 3 scalars of identical base-49 length but different numerical values produce equal yield counts in `scalarMultiplierAsync`. Catches accidental data-dependent yield cadences in future refactors.
- **T3.5 forced-failure tests** — 6 cases at gen1 + registry layers proving `SchnorrSignError` propagation through the public registry API, the Genesis inline adapter, the gen1-factory shared adapter, and both sync + async sign surfaces.

### Changed

- **TypeScript `sign` throw contract (consumer-observable).** Previously, `schnorrSign` (and registry-level `primitive.sign`) returned `""` on internal failure (specifically when Fiat-Shamir challenge derivation produced null due to unparseable public key); v3.1.0 throws `SchnorrSignError` instead. Underlying detection condition unchanged — only the failure body changed. This is the SOLE consumer-observable behavior change in this release and the reason for the minor bump.
- **Affects:** `ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts` sync `schnorrSign` + new async `schnorrSignAsync`; propagates through `ts/src/gen1/aliases.ts` `sign` alias, `ts/src/registry/gen1-factory.ts:127` shared adapter, `ts/src/registry/genesis.ts:134` Genesis inline adapter.
- **`ts/src/registry/primitive.ts`** — JSDoc on `CryptographicPrimitive.sign` interface updated to document the new throw contract (replaces prior "returns empty string on failure" wording with "throws `SchnorrSignError` on internal failure").
- See **Migration Guide** below for consumer migration steps.

### Performance

- **Generator-precompute matrix cache.** Go side: `*Ellipse` pointer field with `sync.Once` guard. TS port: `WeakMap<Ellipse, PrecomputeMatrix>`. Eliminates per-call PM rebuilds on the Schnorr hot path. Estimated **~17% sign/verify speed-up** under typical workloads.
- **Per-curve `Modular` cache (TS port).** `WeakMap<Ellipse, Modular>` in `schnorr.ts` — eliminates per-call `new Modular(e.p)` allocations.
- **Async wrappers (TS port)** yield to the event loop every 8 outer-loop iterations on a fixed data-independent cadence (browser INP < 200 ms target met for the `scalarMultiplierAsync` / `schnorrSignAsync` / `schnorrVerifyAsync` path).
- **Test timeouts tightened.** Vitest timeouts on the slowest tests pulled from 60s/120s down to 30s (closes F-PERF-010 LOW conditionally — tightened ceiling now reflects the post-cache reality).

### Verified

- **Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved** at extended-elided SHA-256 = `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae` (post-v2.0.0 baseline; same hash held since v3.0.0 through v3.0.3 and now v3.1.0).
- **All 50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap + 20 Schnorr deterministic records** byte-identical to the committed v3.0.3 corpus.
- **User-provided seed-word verification fixture** byte-for-byte identical pre-v3.1.0 vs post-v3.1.0 across the full keygen pipeline (bitstring → int10 → int49 → public key → Standard + Smart Ouronet accounts). The PM cache and async wrappers are pure performance/ergonomic additions; they do not perturb any deterministic output.

### Doc/Audit

- **AUDIT.md** updated with four `RESOLVED v3.1.0` closure rows (F-TEST-001, F-PERF-001, F-PERF-004, F-API-001) appended to the TypeScript-port findings table at lines 316-319; section heading at line 310 extended to enumerate the four new closures alongside the existing v3.0.3 closures.
- **AUDIT.md** "Last updated:" preamble at line 5 bumped from `2026-05-01 (after frontend-fixes closure shipped at v3.0.3)` to `2026-05-02 (after high-additive-bundle closure shipped at v3.1.0)` (deferred from Phase 1 T1.4 to the cross-phase release boundary per the Phase 1 plan-review fix).
- **AUDIT.md** "Hardening Status (current as of `vX.Y.Z`)" header at line 10 bumped from `v3.0.3` to `v3.1.0` in lock-step with the preamble.
- **AUDIT.md** SC-5 historical entry at line 230 annotated with `regression-pinned in tests at v3.1.0 — see ts/tests/gen1/schnorr.test.ts (off-curve R + off-curve P cases) and Elliptic/Schnorr_adversarial_test.go` (delivered by Phase 1 T1.4; carried forward unchanged).

### Migration Guide

The throw-contract change is the only consumer-observable behavior change. Update any consumer code that catches the prior empty-string sentinel:

**Before v3.1.0:**

```ts
const sig = primitive.sign(kp, msg);
if (sig === '') { /* handle failure */ }
```

**After v3.1.0:**

```ts
import { SchnorrSignError } from '@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1';
try {
  const sig = primitive.sign(kp, msg);
  // ...
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof SchnorrSignError) {
    /* handle failure */
  } else {
    throw e;
  }
}
```

The new async surfaces (`schnorrSignAsync`, `schnorrVerifyAsync`, `scalarMultiplierAsync`) are pure additions — every existing sync export remains in place at the same import path with the same signature.

Implementation mode: **quality**. Spec lifecycle: high-additive-bundle (audit-spec composition; Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3).

## [3.0.3] — 2026-05-01

**Frontend ergonomics + README CI gate (patch).** Closes audit findings F-FE-001 (TypeScript port — README quick-start broken examples + missing aliases) and F-INT-002 (TypeScript port — registry detect example uses wrong field path) by (1) adding six plain-text-friendly ergonomic alias exports to `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1` (`sign`, `verify`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `textToBitString`, `bitStringToText`) so the README quick-start snippets become real, callable code; (2) rewriting all five broken `ts`-tagged code blocks in `ts/README.md` (Mint, Quick-Start Sign, Quick-Start AES, Detect, Subpaths) so every example compiles cleanly under tsc; (3) adding a new `npm run docs:check` script + matching CI step that extracts every fenced `ts`/`typescript` block from `ts/README.md` and typechecks it on every push, preventing future README drift. **366/366 TS tests pass** (347 baseline + 11 new alias round-trip tests + 8 new CI-workflow structural tests in `ts/tests/ci-workflow/`). Pure additive — every existing export remains in place; no breaking changes.

### Changed

- **`ts/README.md`** — five broken `ts`-tagged code blocks rewritten:
  - **Mint block** (lines 98-139): all imports hoisted to the top of the block (TypeScript ESM rule), bitmap is now created programmatically (`Array.from({ length: 40 }, () => Array<0 | 1>(40).fill(0))` — exactly 1600 pixels, no `/* ... */` placeholder), base-10 scalar is a finite digit string, base-49 scalar uses only `BASE49_ALPHABET` characters, undeclared `someStandardAddress` replaced with `account.standardAddress`, no declared-but-unused variables (compatible with inherited `noUnusedLocals: true`).
  - **Quick-Start Sign block** (lines 143-149): imports `{ sign, verify }` from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`, calls `sign(account.keyPair, "hello world")` (keyPair-first order), passes signature + message + `account.keyPair.publ` to `verify`.
  - **Quick-Start AES block** (lines 153-158): imports `{ encrypt, decrypt }` from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`, uses `await encrypt(...)` / `await decrypt(...)` (async), asserts the recovered plaintext.
  - **Detect block** (lines 162-165): self-contained — declares `const registry = createDefaultRegistry();` inline, uses an inline address literal, accesses `detected.id` (top-level field, not `detected.metadata.id`), compares against `"dalos-gen-1"` (the actual primitive id, not `"dalos-genesis"`).
  - **Subpaths block** (lines 171-177): every import line references a real named export from its stated subpath. No bare `...` placeholders.

### Added

- **`ts/src/gen1/aliases.ts`** — new file. Six ergonomic wrapper exports re-exported from `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`:
  - `sign(keyPair, message)` — thin pass-through over `schnorrSign` with the conventional keyPair-first argument order.
  - `verify(signature, message, publicKey)` — thin pass-through over `schnorrVerify`.
  - `async encrypt(plaintext, password)` — UTF-8 plaintext → bitstring → `encryptBitString`. Throws on empty input (the bigint round-trip cannot recover empty plaintext through the alias surface; power users can still call `encryptBitString` directly).
  - `async decrypt(ciphertext, password)` — `decryptBitString` → left-pad to multiple of 8 → UTF-8 decode. Round-trip-safe for plaintexts whose first UTF-8 byte is non-zero (0x01–0xFF).
  - `textToBitString(text)` — UTF-8 encode then per-byte 8-bit MSB-first padding (preserves leading zeros, unlike the bigint-based `bytesToBitString` used internally by AES).
  - `bitStringToText(bitString)` — strict 0/1 + length-divisible-by-8 validation, throws verbatim error message on malformed input, decodes via `TextDecoder`.
- **`ts/scripts/check-readme.mjs`** — new Node-stdlib-only README extractor. Reads `ts/README.md`, writes each `ts`/`typescript` fenced block to `ts/.docs-check/block-N.ts`, generates a `.docs-check/tsconfig.json` that extends the project tsconfig, runs `tsc --noEmit` against the temp tree, prints a per-block PASS/FAIL summary, and either cleans up on success or preserves `.docs-check/` for inspection on failure.
- **`ts/tests/ci-workflow/docs-check-step.test.ts`** — new structural assertion tests for the CI workflow. 8 vitest assertions pin the `Check README code blocks` step name, position (after Test, before Upload), absence of an `if:` restriction, no per-step `working-directory:` override, and the workflow's `paths:` filter coverage. Catches future drift to the YAML config that would silently disable the docs:check gate.
- **`ts/package.json`** — new `docs:check` script wired between `clean` and `prepack` in the scripts block (`prepack`/`postpack` lifecycle hooks remain terminal).
- **`.github/workflows/ts-ci.yml`** — new CI step `Check README code blocks` running `npm run docs:check` after `Test` and before `Upload dist`. Runs on every matrix Node version (20, 22, 24). Order is now: Lint → Typecheck → Build → Test → docs:check → Upload.
- **`ts/.gitignore`** — `.docs-check/` excluded from version control (temp directory only persists on docs:check failure).

### Verified

- **Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity:** unchanged. Extended-elided SHA-256 of `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` remains `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae` — byte-identical to v3.0.0, v3.0.1, and v3.0.2. The six new alias exports are pure wrappers over existing primitives; no Genesis crypto code was touched.
- **TS test suite:** 366/366 tests pass across 18 test files (347 baseline + 11 new alias round-trip tests in `ts/tests/gen1/aliases.test.ts` covering all six aliases incl. the empty-plaintext encrypt guard and the multi-byte UTF-8 round-trip path + 8 new CI-workflow structural tests in `ts/tests/ci-workflow/docs-check-step.test.ts` pinning the `Check README code blocks` step's name, position, and config in `ts-ci.yml`).
- **typecheck + Biome lint:** `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` both clean (zero errors, zero issues).
- **`npm run docs:check`:** passes with zero block failures — every `ts`-tagged fenced block in `ts/README.md` typechecks cleanly under the project's strict tsconfig (`strict: true`, `noUnusedLocals: true`, `noUnusedParameters: true`, `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`).

### Doc/Audit

- **`AUDIT.md`** — F-FE-001 and F-INT-002 added as already-resolved at v3.0.3 (Hardening Status summary block + per-file finding rows + new v3.0.3 remediation table row).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this entry.

### Migration Guide

- **No action required for any user.** Pure additive change: six new exports under `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`, plus a new `docs:check` developer script and CI gate. Every existing export remains at the same import path with the same signature. README republishes alongside this release with the corrected examples.

Implementation mode: **quality**. Spec lifecycle: /bee:audit (2026-04-29) → /bee:new-spec (high-frontend-fixes audit-spec) → /bee:plan-all (2 phases, 10 tasks, plan-review iter1+1, cross-plan iter1) → /bee:ship (autonomous execution + review).

---

## [3.0.2] — 2026-05-01

**Release-engineering hygiene (patch).** Closes a documentation-discoverability gap by (1) bundling `CHANGELOG.md` into the npm tarball so consumers see the version history without leaving npmjs.com, (2) auto-creating a GitHub Release object on every `ts-vX.Y.Z` tag push so the repo's Releases page surfaces every shipped version with formatted notes, and (3) backfilling GitHub Release objects for the 5 prior tags (`ts-v1.0.0`, `ts-v1.1.0`, `ts-v1.2.0`, `ts-v3.0.0`, `ts-v3.0.1`) that pushed but did not produce Release entries. No code changes; same fix pattern recently applied in sibling project `StoaChain/OuronetCore`.

### Changed

- **`ts/package.json`** — `files` array extended from `["dist", "README.md", "LICENSE"]` to `["dist", "README.md", "LICENSE", "CHANGELOG.md"]`. New `prepack` and `postpack` scripts copy/clean the root `CHANGELOG.md` into `ts/` around `npm pack` / `npm publish`. Cross-platform via Node `fs.copyFileSync` / `fs.unlinkSync` (works on Linux CI + Windows local).

### Added

- **`.github/workflows/ts-publish.yml`** — new step `Create GitHub Release for the pushed tag` runs after `npm publish --access public`. Uses `gh release create` with `--notes-from-tag --latest`. Idempotent: skips if a Release already exists for the tag.
- **`.github/workflows/ts-publish.yml`** — new step `Backfill GitHub Releases for prior tags (idempotent)` iterates over the 5 prior `ts-v*` tags. For each, checks whether a Release exists; if not and the tag exists in git history, creates one via `gh release create --notes-from-tag`. Skips silently for already-existing Releases or missing tags.
- **`.github/workflows/ts-publish.yml`** — job-level `permissions: contents: write` block. Required to allow the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` to create Releases (HTTP 403 without it). Workflow-level permission stays at `contents: read` for safety.

### Verified

- **Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity:** unchanged (no crypto code touched). Extended-elided SHA-256 of `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` remains `082f7a40405d4c075f1975af0a6075bb0228bbccae60a53b05b350a09ce223ae`.
- **TS test suite:** 347/347 tests pass (no test changes from v3.0.1).
- **`npm pack --dry-run`:** confirms `CHANGELOG.md` is now in the tarball alongside `dist/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`.

### Doc/Audit

- **`README.md`** (top-level) — Status section bumped to `@stoachain/dalos-crypto@3.0.2`.

### Migration Guide

- **No action required for any user.** No public API changes. Pure release-engineering hygiene.

### Operational note

The corresponding GitHub repo setting **"Workflow permissions"** must be set to "Read and write permissions" (Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions) for the new Release-creation steps to succeed. The YAML `permissions: contents: write` is capped by this org/repo-level toggle. If left at the restrictive default, the npm publish step succeeds but the Release-creation step returns HTTP 403. This was set as a one-time toggle for the StoaChain organisation alongside this release.

Implementation mode: **quality**. Spec lifecycle: ad-hoc release-engineering fix (no `/bee:new-spec` — small enough to ship inline; pattern replicated from sibling project `StoaChain/OuronetCore`'s recent `v2.0.3` release).

## [3.0.1] — 2026-04-30

**Error-handling closure (patch).** Closes three HIGH-severity error-handling stragglers from the 2026-04-29 audit (F-ERR-001, F-ERR-002, F-ERR-003) that completes the KG-2 hardening missed in v2.1.0. **347/347 TS tests pass (was 346/346 in v3.0.0; +1 new failure-injection test from T1.2); Go test suite green.** (348/348 acceptable upper bound if T1.2 split into two test cases.)

### Changed

- **F-ERR-001** (TS port `encryptAndPad`): `ts/src/gen1/aes.ts:248-254` now throws `Error('encryptAndPad: underlying encryption failed')` when the underlying `encryptBitString` returns the empty-string sentinel. Previously silently returned `{ ciphertext: '', ciphertextBits: 0 }` — a data-loss vector that masked AES-GCM primitive failures. Underlying `encryptBitString:178-180` empty-string return preserved (Go byte-identity).
- **F-ERR-002** (Go `ExportPrivateKey`): `Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:548-551` `os.Create` failure path no longer calls `log.Fatal(err)`. Replaced with the v2.1.0 KG-2 sibling pattern (`fmt.Println("Error: failed to create export file:", err); return`). Library code no longer kills its host process. Void signature preserved; zero caller changes.
- **F-ERR-003** (Go `ProcessIntegerFlag`): `Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:363-365` `os.Exit(1)` removed. Function returns `""` on invalid input (matches `EncryptBitString` / `SchnorrSign` v2.1.0 sentinel vocabulary). Library code no longer kills its host process. The 5 CLI call sites in `Dalos.go` (lines 197, 202, 214, 218, 239) updated to check the empty-string sentinel and bail at the driver level. `string` return type preserved.

### Added

- **`ts/tests/gen1/aes.test.ts`** — new `vi.spyOn` failure-injection test for `encryptAndPad` (codebase's first `vi.spyOn` use). Asserts that an induced `subtle.encrypt` rejection causes `encryptAndPad` to throw rather than silently return garbage.
- **`Elliptic/KeyGeneration_test.go`** — new stdout-capture regression test for `ExportPrivateKey`'s `os.Create` failure branch (codebase's first Go stdout-capture test). Asserts the function prints the expected diagnostic and returns cleanly without process termination.
- **`Elliptic/KeyGeneration_test.go`** — new function-level test for `ProcessIntegerFlag` invalid-input → `""` return.
- **`dalos_smoke_test.go`** (or equivalent) — new CLI smoke-test invoking `Dalos.go` with an invalid integer flag and asserting non-zero exit + diagnostic output.

### Verified

- **Static evidence:** `grep -rn "log\.Fatal\|os\.Exit" Elliptic/` returns zero matches post-fix (was 2 matches pre-fix).
- **Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity:** SHA-256 (timestamp+version-elided) of `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` remains `037ac01a4df6e9113de4ea69d8d4021f5adaa2a821eb697ffe3009997d3c24e9`. Error-path edits do not perturb deterministic happy-path output.
- **Historical corpus byte-identity:** `testvectors/v1_historical.json` deterministic content unchanged.
- **TS test suite:** 347/347 tests pass (was 346/346 in v3.0.0; +1 new failure-injection test added by T1.2). 348/348 acceptable upper bound if T1.2 split into two test cases.
- **Go test suite:** `go test ./...` exits 0.

### Doc/Audit

- **`AUDIT.md`** — KG-2 row reclassified from `RESOLVED v2.1.0` to `COMPLETED v3.0.1 (partial in v2.1.0; stragglers F-ERR-002/F-ERR-003)`; AES-3 row reclassified analogously (straggler F-ERR-001). New v3.0.1 remediation row added. Genesis-frozen-through-versions chain extended.

### Migration Guide

- **No action required for any user.** No public API changes (sibling-mirror keeps `ExportPrivateKey` void; empty-string sentinel keeps `ProcessIntegerFlag` `string` return; `encryptAndPad` throw matches dominant TS pattern). Patch bump per semver.

Implementation mode: **premium**. Spec lifecycle: `/bee:audit` (2026-04-29) → `/bee:new-spec` (2026-04-30 error-handling-fixes) → `/bee:plan-phase` (1 phase, 13 tasks) → `/bee:execute-phase` → `/bee:ship`.

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-30

**Phase 8 landed — Historical curves byte-identity (LETO + ARTEMIS) and unified version bump.** The Go reference is realigned with the TypeScript port at four cross-curve byte-identity sites (XCURVE-1..4), formalizing the byte-identity contract for all four production curves (DALOS Genesis + LETO + ARTEMIS + APOLLO). **346/346 tests pass.**

> **⚠️ WIRE-FORMAT BREAK for LETO and ARTEMIS.** Schnorr signatures and seedword-derived keys for LETO (S=545) and ARTEMIS (S=1023) generated by the Go reference at `< v3.0.0` will NOT verify or reproduce under `>= v3.0.0`. APOLLO (S=1024, byte-aligned) and DALOS Genesis (S=1600, byte-aligned) outputs are **unchanged** — the per-vector deterministic outputs match byte-for-byte across the version boundary.

### Added

- **`Auxilliary/CeilDiv8(x int) int`** — single source of truth for the bit-to-byte ceiling rule. Replaces inline `(x+7)/8` and floor `x/8` idioms across the Go reference. Documented with a docstring warning future maintainers against re-inlining the floor expression.
- **`testvectors/v1_historical.json`** — new corpus (`schema_version: 2`) covering LETO + ARTEMIS + APOLLO with 60 vectors total (10 bitstring + 5 seedwords + 5 Schnorr per curve). Pinned for byte-identity contract against the TypeScript port. Generated alongside `v1_genesis.json` by a single `go run testvectors/generator/main.go`.
- **TS-side byte-identity test infrastructure** — `ts/tests/fixtures.ts` gains `loadHistoricalCorpus()` + 9 per-curve accessors with `schema_version === 2` assertion. `ts/tests/registry/historical-primitives.test.ts` gains 9 new BYTE-IDENTITY blocks (3 per curve: bitstring + seedwords + Schnorr) asserting all 60 historical vectors reproduce byte-for-byte.
- **`ts/tests/fixtures.schema.test.ts`** — new test file with 6 schema-version assertion tests (closes long-standing F-TEST-008: Genesis loader silently accepted any schema).

### Changed (XCURVE-1..4 — wire-format change for non-byte-aligned curves)

- **XCURVE-1** (`Elliptic/Schnorr.go:216` `SchnorrHash`): `outputSize := int(e.S) / 8` → `outputSize := aux.CeilDiv8(int(e.S))`. Aligns Schnorr Fiat-Shamir digest size with the TS port's `Math.ceil(e.s / 8)` semantics.
- **XCURVE-2** (`Elliptic/Schnorr.go:247` `deterministicNonce`): `expansionSize := 2 * int(e.S) / 8` → `expansionSize := aux.CeilDiv8(2 * int(e.S))`. Aligns deterministic-nonce expansion size.
- **XCURVE-3** (`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:161` `SeedWordsToBitString`): `OutputSize := int(e.S) / 8` → `OutputSize := aux.CeilDiv8(int(e.S))`. Aligns seedwords→bitstring output size. Inline comment block at lines 158-160 rewritten — no longer asserts divisibility-by-8.
- **XCURVE-4** (`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:173-193` `ConvertHashToBitString`): rewritten to mirror `ts/src/gen1/hashing.ts:108-129` byte-for-byte. New logic: per-byte `fmt.Sprintf("%08b", b)` concatenation, then truncate-from-right or left-pad-with-zeros. Replaces the prior `bytes → hex → big.Int → big.Int.Text(2) → left-pad` pipeline that silently elided leading zero bits.

### Verified

- DALOS Genesis 105-vector corpus byte-identity preserved across XCURVE fixes (timestamp-elided SHA-256 stable; only `generated_at_utc` and `generator_version` metadata fields differ between pre- and post-v3.0.0 commits).
- APOLLO byte-identity preserved (S=1024 byte-aligned). Pre-fix vs post-fix per-output SHA-256 comparison yields zero diff across keys, addresses, Schnorr signatures, and a hand-crafted leading-zero hash probe.
- Historical corpus determinism verified: twice-run regeneration produces byte-identical `v1_historical.json` SHA-256 (timestamp-elided).
- All 15 historical Schnorr signatures self-verify to true (post-v2.0.0 deterministic).
- Per-curve historical-corpus prefixes verified: 15× LETO `Ł.`/`Λ.`, 15× ARTEMIS `R.`/`Ř.`, 15× APOLLO `₱.`/`Π.` — zero DALOS-prefix (`Ѻ.`/`Σ.`) leakage in historical corpus.
- `go build ./...` exits 0; `go test ./...` exits 0 (Auxilliary 13 + Elliptic 7 = 20 unit tests pass).
- `npm test` from `ts/` exits 0 → 346/346 tests pass across 16 test files.

### Doc/Audit

- **`AUDIT.md`** — XCURVE-1..4 entries added under a new Category C ("Cross-curve byte-identity fixes") in the hardening status table, marked `✅ RESOLVED v3.0.0`.
- **TS doc-blocks corrected** for `ts/src/historical/{index,leto,artemis,apollo}.ts` and `ts/src/registry/{leto,artemis,apollo}.ts`. Removed pre-v1.2.0 "NOT production primitives, NOT registered, NOT Schnorr" claims; replaced with truthful status: production primitives, registered via `ts/src/registry/{leto,artemis,apollo}.ts`, byte-identical with Go reference v3.0.0+. Closes F-ARCH-003.
- **`docs/HISTORICAL_CURVES.md`** — new "Byte-Identity Formalization (v3.0.0+)" subsection describing the corpus, the wire-format break for LETO/ARTEMIS, and the four XCURVE fixes.
- **`testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md`** — new v3.0.0 entry recording both corpus SHA-256 values and the verification protocol used.

### Migration Guide

- **DALOS Genesis users:** No action required. Genesis output is byte-identical across the v3.0.0 boundary. Existing `Ѻ.` / `Σ.` accounts remain derivable.
- **APOLLO users:** No action required. APOLLO S=1024 is byte-aligned and produces identical output before/after the XCURVE fixes.
- **LETO users:** Schnorr signatures and seedword-derived keys generated under `< v3.0.0` will NOT round-trip under `>= v3.0.0`. Re-derive with the new code.
- **ARTEMIS users:** Same as LETO. Re-derive.

Implementation mode: **premium**. Spec lifecycle: `/bee:audit` → `/bee:audit-to-spec` → `/bee:new-spec` (design decision: align Go to TS) → `/bee:plan-all` (5 phases, 24 tasks across 16 waves) → `/bee:ship` (autonomous execution + per-phase regression gates).

## [2.9.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 7 landed — Cryptographic Primitive Registry.** Adds the abstraction layer that lets future Gen-2 primitives register alongside Gen-1 without breaking existing Ouronet accounts. No new cryptography; pure architecture. **268/268 tests pass.**

The TypeScript port's Gen-1 cryptographic surface is now FEATURE-COMPLETE and registry-ready.

### Added

- **`ts/src/registry/primitive.ts`** — the `CryptographicPrimitive` interface:
  - Value types: `KeyPair`, `PrivateKeyForms`, `FullKey`, `PrimitiveMetadata`
  - Core interface: `CryptographicPrimitive` (all primitives must implement: 4 keygen paths + address derivation + detection + optional sign/verify)
  - Extension interface: `DalosGenesisPrimitive` (adds `generateFromBitmap`)
  - Type guard: `isDalosGenesisPrimitive(p)`
- **`ts/src/registry/genesis.ts`** — `DalosGenesis` primitive instance:
  - Thin adapter wrapping `ts/src/gen1/*.ts` into the primitive interface
  - Stable id: `"dalos-gen-1"`, version 1, generation `"genesis"`
  - Rich metadata: curve params + bitmap dims + address prefixes + hashing scheme + Schnorr v2 domain tags
  - `detectGeneration(address)` returns true for `Ѻ.xxx` / `Σ.xxx`
- **`ts/src/registry/registry.ts`** — `CryptographicRegistry` class + `createDefaultRegistry()` factory:
  - `register(p)` — throws on duplicate id; first-registered becomes default
  - `unregister(id)` — reassigns default to first remaining; clears default if empty
  - `get(id)`, `has(id)`, `all()`, `size()` — inspection
  - `detect(address)` — find primitive by `detectGeneration` match
  - `default()` / `setDefault(id)` / `defaultIdOf()` — default management
- **`ts/src/registry/index.ts`** — public surface for `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/registry` subpath
- **`ts/tests/registry/registry.test.ts`** — 34 tests covering:
  - DalosGenesis identity + metadata correctness
  - All 5 keygen paths reproduce Go corpus through the primitive interface
  - Generate-then-round-trip for random keys
  - `detectGeneration` accepts Ѻ./Σ. and rejects others
  - Signing byte-identical to Go corpus (smoke-tested on vector[0])
  - Tampered-message verification rejection
  - Full lifecycle: register / duplicate-id / unregister / unknown-id / empty registry / setDefault
  - Multi-primitive dispatch via a stub Gen-2 with `Ω.` detection
  - End-to-end scenario: create account → detect by address → sign → verify

### Subpath export

Added `"./registry"` to `package.json` exports. Consumers can now import as:

```typescript
import { createDefaultRegistry, DalosGenesis } from '@stoachain/dalos-crypto/registry';
```

### Architecture implications

Future Gen-2 primitive (e.g., a post-quantum scheme) plugs in by:

```typescript
const registry = createDefaultRegistry();
registry.register(DalosGen2);
// Existing Ѻ./Σ. addresses still dispatch to DalosGenesis via .detect()
// New addresses (e.g., 'Q.xxx') dispatch to DalosGen2
// registry.setDefault('dalos-gen-2') makes new keygen use Gen-2
```

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → 0 errors across 32 files
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build` → exit 0
- `npm test` → **268/268 tests pass in 27 s**

### Updated

- `ts/src/index.ts` — SCAFFOLD_VERSION `0.6.0` → `0.7.0`; added top-level `export * as registry`
- `ts/tests/scaffold.test.ts` — version expectation updated
- `ts/package.json` — new `"./registry"` subpath export
- `docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md` — Phase 7 marked DONE

### Next

Phase 8 — integration into `@stoachain/ouronet-core`. The ouronet-core library at npm will start consuming `@stoachain/dalos-crypto` via the registry surface. Codex / key storage / signing flows begin using the TS port instead of the `go.ouronetwork.io/api/generate` call.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-04-23

**🎯 PHASE 6 LANDED — SCHNORR V2 BYTE-IDENTITY PROVEN.** Complete port of the v2.0.0 hardened Schnorr scheme with all seven audit findings resolved. Signatures match the Go corpus byte-for-byte across all 20 committed vectors. 234/234 tests pass.

### Added

- **`ts/src/gen1/schnorr.ts`** — hardened Schnorr v2:
  - **Constants**: `SCHNORR_HASH_DOMAIN_TAG` = `'DALOS-gen1/SchnorrHash/v1'`, `SCHNORR_NONCE_DOMAIN_TAG` = `'DALOS-gen1/SchnorrNonce/v1'`
  - **Types**: `SchnorrSignature` interface
  - **`bigIntBytesCanon(x)`** — canonical big-endian bytes (zero → `[0x00]`, matches Go)
  - **`serializeSignature(sig)`** / **`parseSignature(str)`** — `"{R-in-pubkey-form}|{s-base49}"` format, round-trip safe
  - **`schnorrHash(R, pk, msg)`** — Fiat-Shamir challenge via length-prefixed Blake3(200 bytes) mod Q (SC-1, SC-3)
  - **`schnorrMessageDigest(msg)`** — 64-byte tagged hash used for nonce derivation
  - **`deterministicNonce(k, msgDigest)`** — RFC-6979-style via tagged Blake3 XOF (400-byte expansion → mod Q, bias ≤ 2⁻¹⁵⁹⁶) (SC-2)
  - **`schnorrSign(keyPair, message)`** — fully deterministic signing
  - **`schnorrVerify(sig, msg, pk)`** — with SC-4 range check, SC-5 on-curve validation, SC-6 explicit errors
- **`ts/tests/gen1/schnorr.test.ts`** — 26 tests:
  - Constants + `bigIntBytesCanon` edge cases
  - Message digest + nonce determinism
  - Signature serialization round-trip for all 20 committed sigs
  - **`schnorrSign` reproduces all 20 Go signatures byte-for-byte**
  - **`schnorrVerify` accepts all 20 committed signatures**
  - Cross-run determinism (sign twice → identical output)
  - Different messages → different signatures
  - Empty message + Unicode (including 𝔸𝔹ℂ supplementary plane)
  - Negative tests: tampered message / pubkey / s=0 / s≥Q / malformed sig

### 🎯 Byte-identity gate — strongest so far

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `schnorrSign(keyPair, msg)` for each of 20 vectors produces a signature string equal to the committed `v.signature` | ✅ **20/20 byte-identical** |
| `schnorrVerify(v.signature, v.message, v.public_key)` for each of 20 vectors | ✅ **20/20 true** |
| Signature parse/serialize round-trip for all 20 | ✅ **20/20 round-trip** |
| Unicode (BMP + supplementary) messages sign and verify | ✅ pass |
| Empty message signs and verifies | ✅ pass |

This is the **strongest byte-identity result in the port so far**. Unlike Phase 3/4 (which matched derivations), Phase 6 matches specific signature bytes — meaning the tagged Blake3 KDF, the deterministic nonce derivation, the length-prefixed transcript construction, the scalar multiplication for R, and the serialization all match Go byte-for-byte.

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → 0 errors across 27 files
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build` → exit 0
- `npm test` → **234/234 tests pass in 27 s**

### What this means

The cryptographic surface of the TS port is now **feature-complete and functionally interoperable with Go v2.0.0+**:
- All 6 key-generation input types (Phase 4)
- AES encrypted-file I/O (Phase 5)
- Schnorr v2 sign and verify (Phase 6)

Phase 7 adds the `CryptographicPrimitive` registry pattern so future Gen-2 primitives can plug in cleanly, then Phase 8+ handle integration into `@stoachain/ouronet-core` and the OuronetUI migration.

### Updated

- `ts/src/gen1/index.ts` — exports Phase 6 Schnorr surface
- `ts/src/index.ts` — SCAFFOLD_VERSION `0.5.0` → `0.6.0`
- `ts/tests/scaffold.test.ts` — version expectation updated
- `docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md` — Phase 6 marked DONE

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 5 landed — TypeScript AES-256-GCM wrapper.** Complete port of the Go `AES/AES.go` encryption layer with all v2.1.0 hardening applied and one TS-port robustness improvement (nonce-first-nibble constraint that eliminates a latent roundtrip bug in the Go reference). 208/208 tests pass.

### Added

- **`ts/src/gen1/aes.ts`** — AES-256-GCM encryption module:
  - `bitStringToBytes(bits)` — bitstring → bigint → hex → bytes, matching Go's `BitStringToHex` (including Go's partial-decode behaviour for odd-nibble magnitudes)
  - `bytesToBitString(bytes)` — reverse, matching Go's `CipherTextDec.SetString(hex, 16).Text(2)`
  - `makeKeyFromPassword(pw)` — single-pass Blake3 → 32-byte AES key, matching Go exactly
  - `zeroBytes(b)` — best-effort scrub helper (matches Go's v2.1.0 `ZeroBytes`)
  - `encryptBitString(bits, pw)` — AES-256-GCM with 12-byte random nonce; returns `""` on failure (matches v2.1.0 Go)
  - `decryptBitString(bits, pw)` — throws typed errors on failure (matches v2.1.0 Go)
  - `encryptAndPad` / `decryptAndPadToLength` — convenience wrappers for fixed-width round-tripping (restores leading zeros lost in the bigint-based byte encoding)
- **`ts/tests/gen1/aes.test.ts`** — 28 tests covering:
  - `bitStringToBytes` / `bytesToBitString` edge cases (empty, all-zero, odd-nibble)
  - Key derivation determinism + Unicode passwords
  - Round-trip encryption/decryption
  - Wrong password fails (AES-GCM auth-tag mismatch)
  - Corrupted ciphertext fails
  - Different ciphertext each call (random nonce)
  - **1600-bit round-trips across 24 committed bitstring vectors** (those whose magnitude is even-nibble hex length — the other 26 hit the documented Go AES-wrapper limitation)
  - Wrong-password rejection across 10 vectors

### TS-port improvement over Go reference

The Go `AES/AES.go` has a latent bug: when the random nonce's first byte has a zero TOP NIBBLE (e.g., `0x0F` or lower), the bytes→bigint→binary encoding of the combined ciphertext loses that nibble and the ciphertext cannot be decrypted. This affects ~6.25% of nonces → ~6.25% of encryptions produce unreadable ciphertexts in the Go CLI.

The TS port constrains the nonce generation to `nonce[0] >= 0x10`, eliminating this failure case. This is **interoperable with Go**: TS-produced ciphertexts always decrypt cleanly under Go (Go's decrypt works for any nonce, it's only Go's encrypt that has the latent bug). Documented in `aes.ts` with rationale.

### Known limitations (matches Go, preserved for byte-identity)

- **Leading zero BITS of the plaintext are lost** — `bigint(bits, 2)` strips them. Use `decryptAndPadToLength(ct, pw, 1600)` to restore them after decryption (matches Go's `strings.Repeat("0", …)` pad-after-decrypt pattern in `ImportPrivateKey`).
- **Plaintexts with odd-nibble magnitude** lose their last half-nibble on encryption (Go's `hex.DecodeString` on odd-length input returns partial bytes + error; the error is discarded). ~50% of random bitstrings hit this. **Not fixable without breaking byte-identity with Go.**
- **Weak password KDF** — single-pass Blake3 with no salt is brute-forceable at GPU speeds for low-entropy passwords. AES-1 and AES-2 marked NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN in AUDIT.md; user responsibility to choose a strong password.

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → 0 errors across 25 files
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build` → exit 0
- `npm test` → **208/208 tests pass in 26 seconds**
- AES round-trips verified on 24 bitstring vectors (even-nibble magnitude subset) + synthesised all-ones/leading-zero patterns
- Wrong password fails on every ciphertext

### Updated

- `ts/src/gen1/index.ts` — exports Phase 5 AES surface
- `ts/src/index.ts` — SCAFFOLD_VERSION `0.4.0` → `0.5.0`
- `ts/tests/scaffold.test.ts` — version expectation updated
- `docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md` — Phase 5 marked DONE

### Next

Phase 6 ports the v2-hardened Schnorr (length-prefixed Fiat–Shamir, RFC-6979-style deterministic nonces, domain-separation tag). Since Schnorr v2 is fully deterministic, signatures will match the Go corpus byte-for-byte for all 20 Schnorr vectors.

---

## [2.6.0] — 2026-04-23

**🎯 PHASE 4 LANDED — END-TO-END BYTE-IDENTITY ACHIEVED.** The TypeScript port is now a functionally complete drop-in replacement for the Go reference's key-generation service. Every one of the 85 address-bearing vectors in the committed Go corpus plus all 20 Schnorr-vector public keys reproduces byte-for-byte through the full TypeScript pipeline. **182/182 tests pass.**

### Added

- **`ts/src/gen1/bitmap.ts`** — 40×40 Bitmap type + utilities mirroring the Go `Bitmap/Bitmap.go` package:
  - `Bitmap` = `readonly (readonly boolean[])[]`  (40 rows × 40 cols)
  - `BITMAP_ROWS`, `BITMAP_COLS` (= 40), `BITMAP_TOTAL_BITS` (= 1600)
  - `bitmapToBitString(b)` — row-major TTB-LTR scan, true→'1', false→'0'
  - `bitStringToBitmapReveal(bits)` — reverse (name flags the secret-sensitive return)
  - `validateBitmap(b)`, `parseAsciiBitmap(rows)`, `bitmapToAscii(b)`, `equalBitmap(a, b)`
- **`ts/src/gen1/key-gen.ts`** — the user-facing Key Generation API:
  - Types: `DalosKeyPair`, `DalosPrivateKey`, `DalosFullKey`
  - Validators: `validateBitString`, `validatePrivateKey` (base 10 & 49)
  - Core pipeline: `generateRandomBitsOnCurve`, `generateScalarFromBitString`, `scalarToPrivateKey`, `scalarToPublicKey`, `scalarToKeyPair`
  - **Six `from*` entry points** matching Genesis input paths:
    1. `fromRandom()` — `crypto.getRandomValues` → 200 bytes → 1600 bits
    2. `fromBitString(bits)` — user bitstring
    3. `fromIntegerBase10(n)` — decimal private-key string (core + clamp bits)
    4. `fromIntegerBase49(n)` — base-49 private-key string
    5. `fromSeedWords(words)` — UTF-8 word list via seven-fold Blake3
    6. `fromBitmap(bitmap)` — 40×40 bitmap
- **`ts/tests/gen1/bitmap.test.ts`** — 13 tests (round-trips, edge cases, `bitmapToBitString` matches `derived_bitstring` for all 20 bitmap vectors)
- **`ts/tests/gen1/key-gen.test.ts`** — 27 tests including **the full end-to-end byte-identity gates**

### 🎯 End-to-end byte-identity validation — THE GATE IS CLEARED

Each assertion below is "for all N vectors, the committed Go-produced output equals what the TS pipeline computes from the same input":

| Input path | Vectors | What's validated | Runtime |
|------------|---------|------------------|---------|
| `fromBitString(input_bitstring)` | 50 bitstring | `scalar_int10`, `priv_int10`, `priv_int49`, `public_key`, `standard_address`, `smart_address` — **all byte-identical** | 5.6 s |
| `fromIntegerBase10(priv_int10)` | 50 bitstring | Same 6 fields byte-identical | 5.4 s |
| `fromIntegerBase49(priv_int49)` | 50 bitstring + 15 seed + 20 Schnorr = 85 | Same 6 fields (minus input_bitstring for seed-words) | 5.3 s + 1.6 s + 2.1 s |
| `fromSeedWords(input_words)` | 15 (ASCII + Cyrillic + Greek + accented Latin + prefix chars) | Derived bitstring, all keys + addresses | 1.6 s |
| `fromBitmap(parseAscii(bitmap_ascii))` | 20 (hand-designed + random patterns) | Derived bitstring, all keys + addresses | 2.1 s |
| `validatePrivateKey(priv_int*, base)` | 50 + 15 + 20 + 20 = 105 | Extracted bitString matches original input | <100 ms |

**Total assertions cleared: 600+ individual byte-identity expectations across all six input paths.**

The TS port now produces **100% byte-identical output to the Go reference** for:
- 1600-bit bitstring → scalar (clamping)
- scalar → 3 private-key representations (bitstring, int10, int49)
- scalar × G → affine public-key point (Phase 2 scalar mult)
- affine point → public-key string (Phase 3 encoding)
- public-key string → 160-char address body (Phase 3 seven-fold Blake3 + char matrix)
- Full `Ѻ.` / `Σ.` address composition

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → 0 errors across 23 files (after auto-fix of template-literal suggestions)
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0 (strictest TS flags)
- `npm run build` → exit 0 (dist/ complete with .js + .d.ts + source maps)
- `npm test` → **182/182 tests pass in 27 s**

### What this means

The TypeScript port at `@stoachain/dalos-crypto@0.4.0` (scaffold version) can now produce identical Ouronet accounts to the Go service at `go.ouronetwork.io/api/generate` for every input the Go service accepts. In Phase 8 (ouronet-core integration) and Phase 9 (OuronetUI migration) we swap the Go remote call for local TS invocation. Existing accounts remain valid forever; new accounts match Go output exactly.

### Next

Phase 5 ports the AES wrapper (AES-256-GCM + Blake3 KDF) for CLI-compatible encrypted key-file import/export. Phase 6 ports the v2-hardened Schnorr.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 3 landed — TypeScript Hashing + address encoding. 🎯 FIRST BYTE-IDENTITY GATE PASSED.** Complete port of `Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go`'s hashing + address-derivation pipeline, plus the 16×16 Unicode `CharacterMatrix`, plus a Blake3 wrapper at `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/dalos-blake3` (subpath; extracted to a sibling npm package in Phase 11). **142/142 tests pass** including the first real byte-identity validation against the committed Go test-vector corpus.

### Added

- **`ts/src/dalos-blake3/index.ts`** — Blake3 XOF wrapper over `@noble/hashes@2.2.0`:
  - `blake3SumCustom(input, outputBytes)` — matches Go's `Blake3.SumCustom` interface
  - `sevenFoldBlake3(input, outputBytes)` — applies Blake3 seven times (the DALOS construction)
  - Exposed as subpath export `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/dalos-blake3` (will be extracted to a separate `@stoachain/dalos-blake3` package at Phase 11)
- **`ts/src/gen1/character-matrix.ts`** — the 256-rune 16×16 matrix from `CharacterMatrix()` in Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go:
  - `CHARACTER_MATRIX_FLAT` — 256-char string in row-major order (BMP chars only; UTF-16 indexing returns single chars)
  - `CHARACTER_MATRIX` — 2D view, `readonly string[][]`
  - `STANDARD_ACCOUNT_PREFIX` = `'Ѻ'` (U+047A, at [0][10])
  - `SMART_ACCOUNT_PREFIX` = `'Σ'` (U+03A3, at [11][9])
- **`ts/src/gen1/hashing.ts`** — hashing + address + public-key format:
  - `toUtf8Bytes(s)` — UTF-8 encode matching Go's `[]byte(string)`
  - `parseBigIntInBase(s, 10|49)` — parse decimal or base-49 strings
  - `seedWordsToBitString(words)` — seed-words → 1600-bit bitstring (seven-fold Blake3 @ 200 bytes)
  - `convertHashToBitString(hash, bitLength)` — pad-leading-zeros bit-string renderer
  - `affineToPublicKey(coord)` — affine → `"prefixLen.base49XY"` format
  - `publicKeyToAffineCoords(pk)` — reverse of above
  - `dalosAddressComputer(publicKeyInt)` — pubkey-int → 160-char address body (seven-fold Blake3 @ 160 bytes → character matrix)
  - `convertToLetters(hash)` — bytes → CHARACTER_MATRIX lookups
  - `publicKeyToAddress(pk)` — full pubkey string → address body
  - `dalosAddressMaker(pk, isSmart)` — adds `Σ.` or `Ѻ.` prefix
- **`ts/tests/dalos-blake3/blake3.test.ts`** — 9 tests (XOF correctness, determinism, seven-fold identity)
- **`ts/tests/gen1/character-matrix.test.ts`** — 15 tests (256 unique BMP chars, key positions Ѻ/Σ, 2D ↔ flat consistency)
- **`ts/tests/gen1/hashing.test.ts`** — 26 tests including **the byte-identity gates against the Go corpus**

### 🎯 Byte-identity gates — FIRST CROSS-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION

| Gate | Check | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| Seed-words → bitstring | `seedWordsToBitString(input_words) === derived_bitstring` for all 15 seed-word vectors (ASCII + Cyrillic + Greek + accented Latin + account prefix chars) | ✅ **15/15 byte-identical** |
| Public-key → standard address | `dalosAddressMaker(public_key, false) === standard_address` for all 85 address-bearing vectors | ✅ **85/85 byte-identical** |
| Public-key → smart address | `dalosAddressMaker(public_key, true) === smart_address` for all 85 address-bearing vectors | ✅ **85/85 byte-identical** |
| Public-key round-trip | `affineToPublicKey(publicKeyToAffineCoords(pk)) === pk` for all 105 vectors | ✅ **105/105 preserved** |

These validations prove that ALL of the following are correct:
- The Blake3 wrapper at `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/dalos-blake3` produces identical output to the Go Blake3 reference
- The seven-fold construction is applied correctly
- UTF-8 encoding matches Go's `[]byte(string)`
- The 256-rune character matrix matches the Go `CharacterMatrix()` at every position
- The `bigIntToBase49` and `base49 → bigint` converters match Go's `big.Int.Text(49)` and `SetString(s, 49)`
- The public-key format (`{prefixLen}.{xyBase49}`) is encoded identically

### Architecture note

The plan called for `@stoachain/dalos-blake3` as a sibling npm package. For Phase 3 implementation, the Blake3 wrapper lives as a subpath at `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/dalos-blake3`. The code layout (its own directory, its own tests, its own subpath export) is ready for extraction: at Phase 11 when we publish to npm, we copy `ts/src/dalos-blake3/` to a new `StoaChain/Blake3/ts/` repo and publish it as `@stoachain/dalos-blake3`, then update `@stoachain/dalos-crypto` to depend on it. This deferral avoids publishing overhead while the port is still mid-flight.

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → clean across 19 files
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build` → exit 0
- `npm test` → **142/142 tests pass in 2.7s**
- `@noble/hashes@2.2.0` installed as first runtime dependency (subpath `@noble/hashes/blake3.js`)

### Next

Phase 4 assembles the full key-generation API (all 6 input paths: random, bitstring, int base-10, int base-49, seed words, bitmap). The end-to-end byte-identity gate against the Go corpus opens up here — every record's `input_bitstring`/`input_words`/bitmap pattern must reproduce the committed `priv_int49`, `public_key`, `standard_address`, `smart_address` fields exactly.

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 2 landed — TypeScript Scalar Multiplication.** Complete port of the base-49 Horner evaluator matching the v1.3.0+ Go reference's branch-free linear-scan implementation. The **critical `[Q]·G = O` proof passed** — a full 1604-bit scalar multiplication produces the identity element, closing the loop on curve-order correctness end-to-end in TypeScript. 92/92 tests pass.

### Added

- **`ts/src/gen1/scalar-mult.ts`** — scalar-multiplication module:
  - `BASE49_ALPHABET` = `"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLM"` (matches Go's `big.Int.Text(49)` exactly)
  - `digitValueBase49(c)` — maps a base-49 digit character to its 0..48 numeric value, with Go's default-0 semantics for invalid chars
  - `bigIntToBase49(n)` — non-negative bigint → base-49 string, matching Go's `big.Int.Text(49)`
  - `scalarMultiplier(scalar, P, e, m, precomputed?)` — branch-free base-49 Horner. Optional pre-built PrecomputeMatrix parameter for hot paths.
  - `scalarMultiplierWithGenerator(scalar)` — shortcut for `scalar · G`
- **`ts/tests/gen1/scalar-mult.test.ts`** — 29 tests covering:
  - Alphabet integrity (49 unique chars, order matches Go)
  - `digitValueBase49` round-trip across all 49 slots
  - `bigIntToBase49` parse round-trip for 500 small scalars + Q-sized scalar
  - Small-scalar identities: `scalarMultiplier(0, G) = O`, `= 1 = G`, `= 2 = 2G`, `= 3 = 3G`, `= 49 = fortyNiner(G)`, chain-of-k for k in 1..20
  - Multi-digit cases: `scalarMultiplier(50, G)` (first 2-digit scalar exercises the fortyNiner transition)
  - Linearity: `mult(a+b) = mult(a) + mult(b)`, `mult(2k) = double(mult(k))`
  - **CRITICAL `[Q]·G = O`**: full 1604-bit scalar mult producing identity (Phase 2 exit criterion)
  - Alternate `[Q-1]·G + G = O` verification
  - On-curve property for 1000-bit pseudo-random scalar

### Algorithm details (hardened, matches Go v1.3.0+)

For every base-49 digit `d` of the scalar:
1. Scan all 48 precompute entries linearly (never exits early)
2. Conditionally select `PM[(d-1)/7][(d-1)%7]` if `d > 0`, else infinity
3. Add the selected point to the accumulator (always, even if selected = infinity — no-op)
4. If not the last digit, multiply accumulator by 49 via `fortyNiner`

Go-level operation sequence is identical for every scalar of the same base-49 length. Closes the macro-level timing channel that the pre-v1.3.0 switch-on-digit code exposed.

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → 0 errors across 13 files
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build` → exit 0
- `npm test` → **92/92 tests pass in 2.5s**
- `[Q]·G = O` verified end-to-end in ~800 ms (285 base-49 digits × 48 PM scans × full 1606-bit arithmetic)

### Performance note

`[Q]·G` runtime (~800 ms in Node 24 with native bigint) is a baseline for Phase 10's optional perf optimisation decision. UX threshold for key-gen: ~1 second per operation is acceptable. Below 3 seconds means no WASM needed.

### Next

Phase 3 adds hashing: `@stoachain/dalos-blake3` (new npm package, published from `StoaChain/Blake3/ts/`) and `ts/src/gen1/hashing.ts` for the seven-fold Blake3 pipeline + 16×16 character-matrix address encoding.

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 1 landed — TypeScript Math Foundation.** Complete port of the pure-arithmetic layer from `Elliptic/PointOperations.go` and `Elliptic/PointConverter.go` to TypeScript. Every function is a line-for-line mirror of the Go reference with preserved intermediate variable names. 63/63 tests pass.

### Added

- **`ts/src/gen1/math.ts`** — `Modular` class with `add`/`sub`/`mul`/`div`/`inv`/`exp`/`neg`/`canon`, plus `bytesToBigIntBE` / `bigIntToBytesBE` / `parseBase10` helpers matching Go's `big.Int` interface.
- **`ts/src/gen1/coords.ts`** — `CoordAffine`, `CoordExtended`, `CoordInverted`, `CoordProjective` interfaces + `INFINITY_POINT_EXTENDED` constant `{ex: 0, ey: 1, ez: 1, et: 0}`.
- **`ts/src/gen1/curve.ts`** — `Ellipse` interface + `DALOS_ELLIPSE` constant (name, P, Q, T, R, S, a, d, G verified byte-for-byte against Go) + `DALOS_FIELD` shared Modular instance + `affine2Extended` / `extended2Affine` / `isInfinityPoint` / `isOnCurve` / `arePointsEqual` / `isInverseOnCurve` predicates.
- **`ts/src/gen1/point-ops.ts`** — HWCD formulas as typed TypeScript: `addition` dispatcher + `additionV1` (mmadd-2008-hwcd) + `additionV2` (madd-2008-hwcd-2) + `additionV3` (add-2008-hwcd), `doubling` dispatcher + `doublingV1` (mdbl-2008-hwcd) + `doublingV2` (dbl-2008-hwcd), `tripling` (tpl-2015-c), `fortyNiner` (3·P → 6·P → 12·P → 24·P → 48·P → 49·P), `precomputeMatrix` (49-element 7×7 matrix for base-49 Horner in Phase 2).
- **`ts/src/gen1/index.ts`** — public gen1 surface. Path: `@stoachain/dalos-crypto/gen1`.
- **`ts/tests/gen1/math.test.ts`** — 14 tests (modular ops, 1606-bit scale, byte conversions, decimal parser).
- **`ts/tests/gen1/curve.test.ts`** — 14 tests (parameter constants match Go; predicates work correctly).
- **`ts/tests/gen1/point-ops.test.ts`** — 28 tests proving every operation via algebraic identity cross-checks.

### Changed

- `ts/src/index.ts` — `SCAFFOLD_VERSION` bumped from `0.0.1` to `0.1.0`. Adds `export * as gen1 from './gen1/index.js'` for top-level discoverability.
- `ts/tests/scaffold.test.ts` — expectation updated to match the new version.

### Verified

- `npm run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings across 11 files
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0 (strictest TS options: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`, all `strict*`)
- `npm run build` → exit 0 (`dist/gen1/*.js` + `.d.ts` + source maps produced)
- `npm test` → **63/63 pass in 1.8s** across 4 test files

### Known edge case (matches Go behaviour)

`fortyNiner(infinity)` is not tested as an algebraic identity because the HWCD addition formulas produce a degenerate Z=0 intermediate when combining infinity with itself via the V2 path. In practice this never occurs — fortyNiner is only called on non-infinity accumulators within base-49 Horner scalar multiplication (Phase 2). The Go reference has the same behaviour.

### Next

Phase 2 (scalar multiplication) adds `ts/src/gen1/scalar-mult.ts` with branch-free base-49 Horner evaluation matching v1.3.0+ Go behaviour. First byte-identity gate against the Go test-vector corpus arrives in Phase 4 (full key-gen pipeline).

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 0b landed — TypeScript build scaffold.** `ts/` subfolder now hosts the `@stoachain/dalos-crypto` package (at v0.0.1), ready for Phase 1 math code to land inside. Zero cryptographic logic yet — pure infrastructure.

### Added

- **`ts/`** subdirectory containing the full TypeScript scaffold:
  - `package.json` — `@stoachain/dalos-crypto@0.0.1`, ES modules, strict subpath exports (`.`, `./gen1`), author = Kjrekntolopon (AncientHoldings GmbH), npm `publishConfig` pointed at npmjs.org
  - `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript 5.7, target ES2022, strictest options (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`, all `strict*` flags)
  - `tsconfig.test.json` — test-only config with Vitest globals
  - `biome.json` — linter + formatter (2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas, LF)
  - `vitest.config.ts` — Node environment, 30s timeout, tests in `tests/` and `src/`
  - `.gitignore` — dist, node_modules, coverage, tsbuildinfo
  - `src/index.ts` — scaffold placeholder exporting `SCAFFOLD_VERSION`
  - `tests/fixtures.ts` — typed loader for `../testvectors/v1_genesis.json` with interfaces `BitStringVector`, `SeedWordsVector`, `BitmapVector`, `SchnorrVector`, `VectorCorpus`
  - `tests/scaffold.test.ts` — 7 tests proving the corpus loader works and all 105 records are accessible
  - `README.md` — package overview, Genesis contract, architecture diagram, dev commands, licence reference
- **`.github/workflows/ts-ci.yml`** — CI matrix across Node 20, 22, 24 with lint + typecheck + build + test steps; uploads dist artifact on Node 24.

### Verified

- `npm install` → 58 packages in 7s (clean install)
- `npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `npm run build` → exit 0 (dist/ produced with `.js` + `.d.ts` + source maps)
- `npm run lint` → exit 0 (clean after auto-fix of import ordering)
- `npm test` → 7/7 tests pass in 1.5s
- All 105 test-vector records accessible via the typed fixture loader

### Next

Phase 1 (TS math foundation) begins in the next push: `src/gen1/math.ts`, `coords.ts`, `curve.ts`, `point-ops.ts`. Every function will be validated byte-for-byte against the Go test-vector corpus.

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 0 finalised — all output-preserving Category-A hardening complete.** Every remaining finding from the v1.0.0 audit is now resolved, NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN (with rationale), or documented as a residual. No items remain in "deferred" state. All 105 test-vector records (50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap + 20 Schnorr) are byte-identical to v2.0.0.

### Fixed

- **PO-3** — `noErrAddition` / `noErrDoubling` helpers added to `Elliptic/PointOperations.go`. Every internal call site in `FortyNiner`, `PrecomputeMatrix`, and `ScalarMultiplier` that previously discarded errors via `_` now routes through these helpers, which panic on any unexpected internal failure (fail-fast instead of silent garbage). No output change for any valid input.
- **KG-2** — `ProcessPrivateKeyConversion`, `ProcessKeyGeneration`, `ExportPrivateKey` (`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go`) now handle error returns from `GenerateScalarFromBitString`, `ScalarToKeys`, and `AES.EncryptBitString`. Previously these cascaded silently into garbage output; now each error prints a diagnostic and the function returns early. CLI contract (void return) preserved.
- **KG-3** — `ZeroBytes(b []byte)` helper added to `AES/AES.go`. `MakeKeyFromPassword` now zeros the intermediate password-bytes buffer and the Blake3 output after copying. `EncryptBitString` / `DecryptBitString` use `defer ZeroBytes(Key)` to scrub the AES key on return, and zero intermediate plaintext byte slices. Best-effort within Go's memory model — documented residual: Go string immutability means the caller's password *string* cannot be scrubbed from inside this library.
- **AES-3** — `EncryptBitString` now returns `""` on any AES primitive failure (NewCipher, NewGCM, nonce generation) instead of `fmt.Println`-ing and continuing with garbage state. `DecryptBitString` returns typed `fmt.Errorf` errors on any failure instead of printing-and-returning-garbage. Callers treat `""` from encrypt as an error signal; decrypt already returned an error, now it's meaningful instead of stale.
- **AES-4** (cosmetic) — removed the pointless `hex.EncodeToString`/`hex.DecodeString` round-trip in `MakeKeyFromPassword`. Replaced with a direct slice copy. Output identical.

### Clarified (moved from "deferred" to "NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN")

- **PO-2** (per-Addition on-curve validation) — prohibitive runtime cost (~10×+ slowdown on key-gen for a ~0 security benefit, since internal `Addition` is never called with attacker-controlled input — external points enter through Schnorr's SC-5 boundary check first). Documented in `AUDIT.md` with rationale.
- **KG-1** (`ImportPrivateKey`) — already had proper error returns in v1.0.0. Re-reviewed in v2.1.0 audit pass; no changes needed. Marked closed.

### Verified

- `go build ./...` → exit 0
- `go vet ./...` → exit 0
- Generator produces 105/105 vectors
- Schnorr self-verify: 20/20
- **Byte-identity vs v2.0.0: all 50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap + 20 Schnorr records are byte-for-byte identical.** Hardening is pure internal refactor — no user-observable output change.

### Final Phase-0 state

Every finding from the v1.0.0 audit is now:
- ✅ RESOLVED (applied, shipped, byte-identity verified where applicable), OR
- ❌ NOT-FIXED-BY-DESIGN (with explicit rationale in AUDIT.md — PO-2 full cost/benefit; AES-1/2 Genesis-file-format preservation; math/big out-of-scope)

**Phase 0 is complete. Next: Phase 0b (TypeScript build scaffold), then Phases 1-12 (TS port proper).**

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 0d landed — Schnorr v2 hardening (Cat-B).** Complete rewrite of the Schnorr sign/verify path with the three output-changing fixes (SC-1, SC-2, SC-3). Genesis key-generation output remains bit-for-bit identical to v1.0.0. Schnorr signature format breaks from pre-v2 — intentional, safe (no on-chain deps).

**Canonical SHA-256 of `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` at v2.0.0: `45c89ec36c30847a92dbd5b696b42d94159900dddb6ce7ad35fca58f4bba16f3`**

### Fixed

- **SC-1** — Length-prefixed Fiat–Shamir transcript. `SchnorrHash` now computes `Blake3(len32(tag) || tag || len32(r) || r || len32(P.x) || P.x || len32(P.y) || P.y || len32(m) || m) mod Q` with 4-byte big-endian length prefixes on every component. Eliminates the pre-v2 leading-zero ambiguity from `big.Int.Text(2)` concatenation.
- **SC-2** — RFC-6979-style deterministic nonces adapted for Blake3. The nonce `z` is now derived from `(private_key, Blake3(tag_msg || message))` via a tagged Blake3 KDF, not `crypto/rand`. Consequence: **`SchnorrSign(k, m)` is now fully deterministic** — same inputs produce byte-identical signatures across runs and across implementations. Eliminates the Sony-PS3 random-nonce-reuse attack family.
- **SC-3** — Domain-separation tags on both the challenge hash (`"DALOS-gen1/SchnorrHash/v1"`) and the nonce derivation (`"DALOS-gen1/SchnorrNonce/v1"`). Prevents hash collisions with any other Blake3-based protocol.
- **SC-4 (full)** — `s` is now reduced mod Q in `SchnorrSign`; `SchnorrVerify` rejects any signature with `s ≥ Q` or `s ≤ 0`. Canonical range `(0, Q)` enforced by both signer and verifier.

### Added

- [`docs/SCHNORR_V2_SPEC.md`](docs/SCHNORR_V2_SPEC.md) — normative specification of the v2 signature format. Implementers porting to other languages (TypeScript port, Rust, etc.) use this as their reference. Contains canonical encodings, signing/verification algorithms, determinism contract, security properties, known residuals, and the pre-v2 incompatibility note.

### Changed

- `Elliptic/Schnorr.go` — `SchnorrSign` and `SchnorrHash` fully rewritten. `SchnorrVerify`'s `s < Q` upper-bound check now active. `deterministicNonce` added as an internal helper.
- `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` — regenerated. All 20 Schnorr signatures now deterministic (stable across runs — verified by running generator twice, byte-identical Schnorr output on second run).

### Verified

- `go build ./...` → exit 0
- `go vet ./...` → exit 0
- Key-gen path: **all 85 deterministic records byte-identical to v1.3.0 and v1.2.0** (50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap). Genesis preservation held.
- Schnorr self-verify: 20/20 signatures verify under the new `SchnorrVerify`.
- Schnorr determinism: 20/20 signatures produce byte-identical output when the generator runs twice with the same inputs.
- Schnorr format break: 20/20 signatures differ from pre-v2.0.0 signatures (expected — SC-1/SC-2/SC-3 all change the output).

### Incompatibility

v2.0.0 signatures fail to verify under pre-v2.0.0 code, and vice versa. No deployed consumer carries Schnorr signatures across this boundary.

### Documented known residual

Go's `math/big` is not constant-time at the CPU-instruction level. v1.3.0's PO-1 hardening closed the macro-level timing channel; v2.0.0 inherits that. Fully-constant-time signing would require a custom limb-oriented big-int implementation — out of scope for the Go reference. Applies only to signers (verifiers observe public inputs).

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 0c landed — Category-A hardening.** All output-preserving security fixes applied to the Go reference. The Genesis key-generation path (bitstring → scalar → public key → address) produces **bit-for-bit identical output** to v1.2.0 for all 85 deterministic test vectors. Schnorr signatures continue to self-verify 20/20.

### Changed (implementation hardening, output preserved)

- **PO-1 (constant-time scalar multiplication)** — `Elliptic/PointOperations.go:ScalarMultiplier` rewritten. The pre-v1.3.0 version was a 49-case switch on base-49 digit characters, creating a macro-level timing side channel where an attacker observing wall-clock time could learn scalar digits. The new version does a branch-free linear scan over all 48 precompute entries for every digit, so the sequence of Go-level operations is identical for every scalar of the same base-49 length. Per-iteration work is constant regardless of scalar content.

  **Byte-for-byte compatibility**: verified against the full 85-record deterministic corpus (50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap). Zero byte drift. The new implementation is a drop-in replacement.

  **Known residual**: Go's `math/big` is not constant-time at the CPU-instruction level; individual `Add`/`Mul`/`Mod` operations may still leak timing through data-dependent limb counts. True constant-time would require a custom limb-oriented implementation (out of scope for the Go reference). The macro-level hardening in v1.3.0 closes the most-exploitable channel and raises attacker cost substantially.

- **SC-4 (partial, Schnorr range check)** — `SchnorrVerify` now rejects signatures with `s ≤ 0`. The stricter `s < Q` upper-bound check is deferred to v2.0.0 because the pre-v2.0.0 Schnorr produces `s = z + H(…)·k` without a mod-Q reduction; historically-valid signatures legitimately have `s ≥ Q`. Preserves backward compatibility for v1.3.0.

- **SC-5 (on-curve validation)** — `SchnorrVerify` now calls `IsOnCurve()` on both `R` (the nonce commitment) and `P` (the public key) before running the verification equation. An attacker-prepared off-curve point no longer interacts with addition formulas in undefined ways. Valid signatures with on-curve points are unaffected.

- **SC-6 (explicit error returns)** — `SchnorrVerify` now returns `false` cleanly on every error path: signature parse failure, nil internal components, public-key parse failure, nil Fiat–Shamir hash, or addition error. The pre-v1.3.0 code used an `if err == nil { … }` pattern that left downstream variables in undefined states, risking nil dereferences.

### Deferred to v1.3.x patches or v2.0.0

The remaining Category-A items are robustness improvements that do not affect output for valid inputs. They're scheduled for incremental patch releases to keep each change surgically reviewable:

- **PO-2** (on-curve validation on every Addition entry — expensive, deferred; already handled at Schnorr boundary)
- **PO-3** (sanity panics in internal paths — deferred)
- **KG-1, KG-2, KG-3** (better error returns + memory hygiene in KeyGeneration — deferred)
- **AES-3** (proper error propagation in AES wrapper — deferred)

### Verified

- `go build ./...` → exit 0
- `go vet ./...` → exit 0
- All 50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap test vectors produce **byte-for-byte identical output** to v1.2.0
- 20/20 Schnorr signatures self-verify under the hardened `SchnorrVerify`

### The v1.3.0 canonical hash

A fresh regeneration of `testvectors/v1_genesis.json` at v1.3.0 produces a different SHA-256 from v1.2.0 because of the timestamp + random Schnorr nonces, but the deterministic-record content is identical. The canonical hash for the **committed** v1.3.0 JSON is recorded in `testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-23

**Phase 0a landed.** Adds the 40×40 black/white bitmap as the 6th key-generation input type to the Go reference, with 20 bitmap test vectors committed. Bit-for-bit equivalent to the existing bitstring path; pure input reshaping, no new cryptographic operations. This primes the TypeScript port (Phase 1 onward) with a Go-validated bitmap oracle.

### Added

- **[`Bitmap/Bitmap.go`](Bitmap/Bitmap.go)** — the `Bitmap` package:
  - `type Bitmap = [40][40]bool` with Genesis conventions **locked**: black pixel = 1, white pixel = 0, row-major TTB-LTR scan, strict pure-B/W (no greys accepted)
  - `BitmapToBitString(b)` — deterministic reshape to 1600-character bitstring
  - `BitStringToBitmapReveal(bitsReveal)` — visualisation inverse; parameter intentionally named to flag that the result IS a private key
  - `ValidateBitmap(b)`, `ParseAsciiBitmap(rows)`, `BitmapToAscii(b)`, `ParsePngFileToBitmap(path)`, `EqualBitmap(a,b)`
- **`(*Ellipse).GenerateFromBitmap(b Bitmap)`** in [`Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go`](Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go) — the 6th key-gen entry point. Under the hood: `BitmapToBitString` → existing `GenerateScalarFromBitString` → existing `ScalarToKeys`. Pure input reshape.
- **20 bitmap test vectors** in [`testvectors/v1_genesis.json`](testvectors/v1_genesis.json):
  - 16 hand-designed patterns (all-white, all-black, checkerboard both parities, horizontal+vertical stripes, border, center cross, top/left halves, both diagonals, center dot, four corners, top-left quadrant, concentric squares)
  - 4 deterministic random (RNG seeded with `0xB17A77`)
  - Cross-check assertion in the generator: `GenerateFromBitmap(b)` produces identical keys to `GenerateFromBitString(BitmapToBitString(b))` for all 20 fixtures
- **Updated generator** [`testvectors/generator/main.go`](testvectors/generator/main.go):
  - Generator version 1.2.0
  - Second RNG stream for bitmap randomness (fixed seed `0xB17A77`) so bitstring vectors are unaffected
  - New `BitmapVector` schema in the JSON corpus (id, pattern, ASCII rendering, derived bitstring, priv/pub/addresses)

### Changed

- **`testvectors/v1_genesis.json`** regenerated. Total vectors: **105** (was 85). Canonical SHA-256: `037ac01a4df6e9113de4ea69d8d4021f5adaa2a821eb697ffe3009997d3c24e9`.
- [`testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md`](testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md) — new section for the 2026-04-23 v1.2.0 run; bitmap-path cross-check listed; determinism proof re-run (42 diff lines = exactly 2 timestamp + 40 Schnorr signatures; all 85 deterministic records byte-identical).
- [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) — new `Bitmap/Bitmap.go` section, no findings (pure reshape). Test-vector total updated to 105.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — version badge bumped to 1.2.0; 6 input paths listed (new §0); status table gains bitmap row; repo structure shows `Bitmap/` + `docs/FUTURE.md` + `testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md`.

### Verified

- `go build ./...` exit 0
- `go vet ./...` exit 0
- Generator produces 105 vectors, all 20 Schnorr sigs self-verify
- Determinism: all 85 deterministic records (50 bitstring + 15 seed-words + 20 bitmap) byte-identical across regeneration runs; only timestamp and Schnorr signatures vary
- Bitmap cross-check: 20/20 fixtures pass `fromBitmap == fromBitString(toBitString(bitmap))`

---

## [1.1.3] — 2026-04-23

### Added / Changed

- [`docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md`](docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md) rewritten to v2 — comprehensive per-phase specification: Locked Decisions section (8 fixed design choices), Phase 0 marked DONE, Phase 0a + 0b added, Phase 4 updated for 6 input types, Phase 5 locked to AES as-is, Phase 6 enumerates the 7 Schnorr hardening items, cross-phase invariants + versioning policy + all 10 decision points. 14 phases total.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-04-23

### Added

- **[`docs/FUTURE.md`](docs/FUTURE.md)** — deferred research directions:
  - Post-quantum primitive families (priority: HIGH; bigger curves explicitly not pursued)
  - Bitmap scan-order variants (opt-in future feature, Genesis locked to row-major TTB-LTR)
  - Additional key-gen input types (audio, geolocation, handwriting — community-driven)
  - Bigger curves — **deliberately not on the roadmap**, with reasoning
  - Third-party audit candidates and budget notes
  - Hardware wallet integration (Ledger/Trezor)

### Changed

- **[`LICENSE`](LICENSE)** — author credit updated with explicit attribution:
  - Kjrekntolopon, Geschäftsführer of AncientHoldings GmbH
  - Contact: Kjrekntolopon@ancientholdings.eu
- **[`README.md`](README.md) Acknowledgements** — same attribution plus brief credit describing the original design and prime-search work on 32-thread Ryzen 5950X.
- **[`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) Sign-off** — same author attribution added.

### Confirmed (design decisions)

- **AES stays as-is.** Single-pass Blake3 KDF, AES-256-GCM. Argon2id upgrade deferred — the AES wrapper is used only for standalone encrypted-key-file export (not by the Ouronet UI, which uses ouronet-core's codex encryption). Changing the KDF would break the encrypted-file format without affecting account addresses; the trade-off is not worth it for Genesis. Weak-KDF note remains in AUDIT.md as "user responsibility to choose strong password".
- **Bitmap conventions for Genesis** (locked):
  - 40 × 40 = 1600 pixels = 1600 bits
  - Black pixel = 1, White pixel = 0
  - Row-major top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan
  - Strict black/white (pure 0x000000 or 0xFFFFFF); reject any other pixel value

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-23

### Added

- **[`testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md`](testvectors/VALIDATION_LOG.md)** — verbatim output of the Go validation suite (`go vet`, `go build`, `gofmt -l`, generator run, determinism proof via diff). Canonical SHA-256 of the committed `v1_genesis.json` is `0ca25d6b6aa9a477fb3a75498cd7bc2082f9f79ccb8b23ab72caad22f28066db`. Anyone can reproduce.

### Verified (again, after v1.1.0 shipped)

- `go vet ./...` — exit 0, no issues
- `go build ./...` — exit 0, self-contained compile
- Test-vector determinism: re-running the generator produces **byte-identical output for all 50 bitstring vectors and 15 seed-word vectors**; only timestamp + 20 Schnorr signatures vary (expected — Schnorr uses random nonce). 64 deterministic records × 2 runs = 100% match.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-23

**Self-containment release.** The Go reference is now self-contained (no external module dependencies) and ships with a reproducible test-vector corpus.

### Added

- **[`LICENSE`](LICENSE)** — Proprietary notice: Copyright © 2026 AncientHoldings GmbH. All rights reserved. Grants inspection, audit, verification-script-execution, and sanctioned-integration rights. Reserves redistribution, derivative works, and commercial-use rights.
- **`Blake3/`** — Blake3 XOF implementation inlined from [`StoaChain/Blake3`](https://github.com/StoaChain/Blake3) (was previously imported as `Cryptographic-Hash-Functions/Blake3`).
- **`AES/`** — AES-256-GCM wrapper with Blake3 KDF, inlined from the same sibling repo. Audit findings added to [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) (mode: GCM ✅, KDF: single-pass Blake3 ⚠️, error handling: needs hardening ⚠️).
- **[`testvectors/v1_genesis.json`](testvectors/v1_genesis.json)** — **85 reproducible input/output vectors**:
  - 50 bitstring → keypair → address vectors (deterministic `math/rand` seed `0xD4105C09702`)
  - 15 seed-word vectors spanning ASCII, Cyrillic, Greek, accented Latin
  - 20 Schnorr sign+self-verify vectors (all pass `verify == true`)
- **[`testvectors/generator/main.go`](testvectors/generator/main.go)** — deterministic Go generator, reproducible by any consumer via `go run testvectors/generator/main.go`.
- **[`docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md`](docs/TS_PORT_PLAN.md)** — 12-phase TypeScript port plan (628 lines, moved in from the consumer-app docs).

### Changed

- `Elliptic/KeyGeneration.go`, `Elliptic/Schnorr.go`, `AES/AES.go` — import paths updated:
  - `"Cryptographic-Hash-Functions/Blake3"` → `"DALOS_Crypto/Blake3"`
  - `"Cryptographic-Hash-Functions/AES"` → `"DALOS_Crypto/AES"`
  
  These are **import-path changes only**. No cryptographic logic was modified. The Genesis key-generation path remains bit-for-bit identical to v1.0.0.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — added Blake3/AES/test-vectors entries to the repository structure and status table, updated licence section, linked to the now-local TS port plan.
- [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) — AES audit section now marked complete with findings.

### Verified

- `go build ./...` completes clean with no errors from the repo root
- All 85 test-vector generation operations succeed
- 20/20 Schnorr signatures self-verify

---

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-23

**First versioned release.** Baseline audited Go reference implementation of DALOS Cryptography (Genesis).

### Added

- **[`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md)** — complete audit report:
  - Mathematical verification of curve parameters (7 tests, all PASS)
  - Per-file source audit (Auxilliary, Parameters, PointConverter, PointOperations, KeyGeneration, Schnorr, Dalos)
  - Categorisation of findings into output-preserving (Cat. A) and output-changing (Cat. B) fixes
  - Remediation roadmap
  - Confidence summary and sign-off
- **[`verification/`](verification/)** — reproducible mathematical verification suite:
  - [`verify_dalos_curve.py`](verification/verify_dalos_curve.py) — Python implementation (gmpy2 + sympy backed)
  - [`verify_dalos_curve.sage`](verification/verify_dalos_curve.sage) — Sage version (Pari/GP deterministic primality)
  - [`README.md`](verification/README.md) — usage guide
  - [`VERIFICATION_LOG.md`](verification/VERIFICATION_LOG.md) — verbatim run output (2026-04-23)
- **[`README.md`](README.md)** — rewritten: project overview, security status, curve parameters, quick-verify guide, roadmap, related repositories, links to audits/tests.
- **[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** — this file.

### Verified

- **P = 2^1605 + 2315** is prime (Miller–Rabin, 50 rounds, error probability ≤ 2⁻¹⁰⁰)
- **Q = 2^1603 + K** is prime (same)
- Cofactor **R = 4** (curve order = 4·Q divides cleanly)
- **d = −26 is a quadratic non-residue mod P** → Bernstein–Lange addition-law completeness
- Generator **G = (2, Y_G)** lies on the curve
- **[Q]·G = O** (G has prime order Q — computed via explicit projective scalar multiplication)
- Safe-scalar size **1600 ≤ log₂(Q) = 1604**

### Changed

- Nothing. All cryptographic code (`Elliptic/`, `Auxilliary/`, `Dalos.go`, `go.mod`) is unchanged from the pre-audit state. The audit explicitly **freezes** the Genesis key-generation path.

### Notes

- **No LICENSE file** in the repo yet. Licensing to be decided before first npm publish.
- The audit is an *internal review*. A third-party cryptographic audit by an accredited firm is recommended before:
  - DALOS Schnorr is used for on-chain authentication
  - DALOS primitives are used in multi-tenant / side-channel-sensitive environments
  - The TypeScript port is used to sign transactions with non-trivial financial consequences

## Pre-1.0.0 history (reconstructed)

Before this changelog was introduced, the repository went through these milestones (preserved in git history):

- **Initial Commit** — original DALOS_Crypto Go implementation by the StoaChain founder. Curve parameters, point operations, key generation, Schnorr, Blake3 integration. Runs on `go.ouronetwork.io` in production serving the Ouronet UI.
- README iterations — basic project description.
